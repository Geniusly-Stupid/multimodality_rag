The Irish Book Awards are Irish literary awards given annually to books and authors in various categories.  It is the only literary award supported by all-Irish bookstores. The primary sponsor is An Post, the state owned postal service in Ireland.

History
First awarded in 2006, the Irish Book Awards grew out of the Hughes & Hughes bookstore's Irish Novel of the Year Prize, which was inaugurated in 2003. Since 2007 the Awards have been an independent not-for-profit company funded by sponsorship. Bord Gáis Energy sponsored the awards from 2012 until 2018, when An Post took over sponsorship.

Description
There are currently nine categories, seven of which are judged by the Irish Literary Academy, and two by a public vote. There is also a lifetime achievement award.
