The 2022 Liga Profesional de Fútbol (officially the Torneo Binance 2022 for sponsorship reasons) was the 132nd season of top-flight professional football in Argentina. The league season began on 3 June and ended on 25 October 2022.
Twenty-eight teams competed in the league: the 26 teams that took part in the previous Primera División season as well as two promoted teams from the 2021 Primera Nacional (Tigre and Barracas Central). River Plate were the defending champions.
On 23 October 2022, Boca Juniors won their 35th national league championship in the last round after they and Independiente drew 2–2 and, simultaneously, River Plate defeated Racing 1–2.

Competition format
The competition was run under a single round-robin, contested by 28 teams (26 from the previous edition plus 2 promoted from Primera Nacional). The champions qualified for the 2023 Copa Libertadores as Argentina 1. The qualification for international tournaments was determined by an aggregate table of the 2022 Primera División and 2022 Copa de la Liga Profesional first stage tournaments.

Season statistics
International qualification
The 2022 Argentine Primera División champions, 2022 Copa de la Liga Profesional champions and 2021–22 Copa Argentina champions earned a berth to the 2023 Copa Libertadores. The remaining berths to the 2023 Copa Libertadores as well as the ones to the 2023 Copa Sudamericana were determined by an aggregate table of the 2022 Argentine Primera División and 2022 Copa de la Liga Profesional first stage tournaments. The top three teams in the aggregate table not already qualified for any international tournament qualified for the Copa Libertadores, while the next six teams qualified for the Copa Sudamericana.

Aggregate table
Relegation
Relegation at the end of the season was based on coefficients, which take into consideration the points obtained by the clubs during the present season (aggregate table points) and the two previous seasons (only seasons at the top flight are counted). The total tally was then divided by the number of games played in the top flight over those three seasons and an average was calculated. The two teams with the worst average at the end of the season were relegated to Primera Nacional. Relegation was reinstated starting from this season after it was suspended by AFA at the end of the 2019–20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
