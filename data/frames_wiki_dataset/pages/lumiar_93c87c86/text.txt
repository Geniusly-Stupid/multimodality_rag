Lumiar (Portuguese pronunciation: [luˈmjaɾ]) is a freguesia (civil parish) and typical quarter of Lisbon, the capital city of Portugal. Located in northern Lisbon, Lumiar is east of Carnide, north of Alvalade, west of Olivais, and south of Santa Clara and partially of Lisbon's border with Odivelas. The population in 2021 was 46,334.

History
Located now within the municipality of Lisbon, it was established in the 13th century.The parish of Lumiar was established on April 2, 1266. In 1312, King Denis (D. Dinis) divided the assets of the Count of Barcelos, allocating to his illegitimate son and the Count's son-in-law, D. Afonso Sanches, a country estate in Lumiar, which came to be known as the Palace of the Infant D. Afonso Sanches (Paços do Infante D. Afonso Sanches). During the reign of King Afonso IV, this noble residence became known as the Lumiar Palace (Paço do Lumiar), a designation still in use today.
In the early 18th century, Lumiar was described as "a place of noble estates, olive groves, and vineyards," with the main agricultural products being wine, wheat, barley, and olive oil.

The parish, once a rural area, has witnessed a steady urban development since the beginning of the 19th century. Still, it was not uncommon for peasants to come to Lumiar up to the first half of the 20th century.
From 1852 to 1886, this parish was part of the Olivais municipality, finally being incorporated into the territory of the city of Lisbon on July 18, 1885.
In the 20th century, there was a significant population increase in the parish — from 2,840 inhabitants in 1900 to over 30,000 in 2000 — resulting in the almost definitive loss of the old village's characteristics due to various residential developments. The current major focus is the Alta de Lisboa neighborhood.

In the 21st century, on October 10, 2007, the final stretch of the North-South Axis (Eixo Norte-Sul) was inaugurated, facilitating traffic flow throughout the Portuguese capital.

The Lumiar Parish is served by the recreational park Quinta das Conchas e dos Lilases.
The parish is composed of 5 major neighbourhoods:

Alta de Lisboa: New neighborhood created as an ambitious real estate project that includes the old neighborhoods of Musgueira Norte and Sul and Calvanas; it is the commercial name of Alto do Lumiar
Calçada de Carriche
Quinta das Conchas
Paço do Lumiar:  where its historical complex stands out
Telheiras (partially shared with Carnide)

Demographics
Historical resident population (before the 2012 Administrative Reform)
The resident population recorded according to Censuses carried over the years is shown in the following table for Lumiar. It is noteworthy that Lumiar gained 37,194 people from 1960 to 2021 or 406.94% of its 1960 population in just 60 years, not having recorded a single population loss since 1960.
Adjusting the 2011 data to the new 2012 boundaries, the population recorded for Lumiar in 2011 stood at 45,605, mainly people hailing from Carnide.
Correcting for the 2012 adjustment due to the new parish's limits, the demographic growth witnessed between 2011 and 2021 stood at +729, or +1.60%. Although at a slow pace, the population grew during the said decade, contrarily to the population of Lisbon as a whole.

Demographic statistics
Age
The last censuses show that the parish's population is ageing at a fast pace: in 2021 25.78% of the population was below 25 and, at the same time, more than a fifth (20.91%) of the residents was 65 or older.

Religion

The parish is predominantly catholic and 72.85% of the population aged 15 or above are followers of a Christian or Jeovah's Witness denomination as of 2021.
Interestingly, around 25.23% of the population doesn't practice a religion and is thus non religious.
The presence of minor religions such as Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism (1.92% of the population amongst the three) is probably due to an increasing community of people coming from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh or Nepal.
The Radha Krishna Temple of the Hindu community is located in the parish. 

Immigration
In 2021, 5.08% of the population of the parish was constituted by foreigners. In particular, amongst women foreigners were 5.48% of the total. This means that in Lumiar there are 2,356 resident foreigners, a sharp increase from 2011, when there were 1,617 resident foreigners (3.55%). Since the foreign population increased by 739 people from 2011 to 2021 (adjusting for the new boundaries) and given that the total population of the parish (adjusting for the new boundaries) increased by 729 units in the same timespan, it is noteworthy that the total population would have decreased weren't it for the increase in immigration; it is also noteworthy that this number only takes into account foreign citizens, thus excluding people who have subsequently acquired Portuguese nationality. The largest group of foreigners is constituted by Brazilians (751 people or +89.17% since 2011), nationals of PALOP countries (527 people or +12.13% since 2011), Chinese (193 people or +46.21%), Spaniards (135 or +18.42% since 2011) and people from the Indian Subcontinent, most notably Nepalis and Indians, totaling 118 people, or recording an increase of +555.56% since 2011.
Dealing with the foreign-born population, 13.02% of the parish's population was born abroad as of 2021. The most common countries of birth were PALOP countries (2,777 people), Brazil (1,234 people), France (224 people), China (185 people), and the Indian Subcontinent (185 people). Of the Portuguese nationals born abroad, the most common countries of birth were PALOP countries (2,304 people) and Brazil (464 people), all countries having ancient historical ties with Portugal as well as a rooted migration history towards the country and who are, thus, more likely to have acquired Portuguese citizenship along the years.
Moreover, as of 2021 in the parish there were 3,939 people who have entered Portugal after 2010, constituting 8.50% of the population. Of those with recent migrant background, 26.20% were Portuguese nationals returning from a period of emigration abroad.

Amongst the Portuguese, 5,474 had already lived abroad as of 2021 (12.54% of the Portuguese population). The majority of those having lived in Angola and Mozambique (2,651 people) entered Portugal in the Seventies (1,625 people or 61.30%), following the independence of the two former colonies (so called retornados). Those coming from countries hosting large Portuguese emigrant communities such as France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Luxembourg or Belgium (1,534 people) have mostly entered Portugal after 1991 (72.23%), probably due to the development of the Portuguese economy since its accession to the EU. Interestingly, 39.41% of the Portuguese nationals having lived in the UK and residing in the parish, has left the UK after 2016, (date of the Brexit referendum).
If the whole population (regardless of the nationality held) is taken into account, then 21.57% of the parish's population has already lived abroad for at least one year as of 2021, with PALOP countries, EU countries, Brazil the United Kingdom and China being the most commonly cited countries of previous residence.

Economy and Social conditions
Employment
In the parish of Lumiar there are 1,370 residents who, as of 2021, were unemployed. Of these, 39.85% received a state-fund subsidy or pension (41.34% in Lisbon). In 2021 the unemployment rate in the parish is considerably lower than the one recorded for Lisbon and for Portugal as a whole, standing at 5.95%. In the same year, Portugal as a whole had an unemployment rate of 8.13% that has progressively decreased to 6.1% in 2023. As the statistics dealing with unemployment at the parish level are available only every 10 years, the current (2023) unemployment rate in Lumiar is unknown. Amongst youth aged 15–24 the unemployment rate in 2021 in the parish stood at 18.19%, 2.62% lower than in the rest of the country.
On the other hand, in 2021 21,651 residents were employed, of which 75.76% were employees and 21.42% were independent workers. Below is the table showing the employment rate per age group. The low share of people aged 20–24 employed is due to the fact that many are still in education (e.g. university) while the low proportion of those in employment aged 60–64 is due to many being early pensioners.

Dealing with commuting, the residents of Lumiar spent 21.48 minutes of daily commuting, 1 minute less than the average inhabitant of Lisbon.

Social conditions
Dealing with overcrowding in the parish's households, 4.30% of the population lives in accommodations where they have less than 15 m2 per capita (8.71% for Lisbon and 5.65% in Portugal as a whole), while 49.99% live in houses with more than 40 m2 per capita (39.64% for Lisbon and 46.84% in Portugal as a whole). There are 3,668.2 dwellings per km2 (3,200.5 for Lisbon and 64.9 in Portugal as a whole).
67.6% of the population lives in owned dwellings as of 2021; this is significantly higher than the value recorded for Lisbon (50.3%) and slightly lower than the one recorded for Portugal (70%). The average height of a residential building in Lumiar is 6.2 floors as of 2021 and the average area of a dwelling stands at 111.94 m2 (with the average in Lisbon-city 93.07 m2 being and in Portugal 112.45 m2).
The average monthly rent value of leased dwellings recorded in 2021 stood at €512.04, 8.74% higher than the Lisbon average in the same year (€470.87). It is nonetheless important to notice that the value of the rents is quite low because of many contracts stipulated decades ago, with 28.17% (25.34% in Lisbon) of the dwellers paying less than €150/month because of the rent-freezing system that was adopted in Portugal in the late XX century, allowing that many people, now mostly elders, don't have to pay high rents. Due to the housing crisis and inflation, in 2023 the average rent for new contracts (frozen contracts aren't concerned) stood in fact at €12-€13/m2 in Lumiar, meaning that for the average 111.94 m2 dwelling are necessary around €1,399/month.
Dealing with housing prices, it is interesting to remark that if the median price per m2 stood at €1,993 for a house sold in early 2016, this value had risen to €2,748/m2 in early 2021 and to €3,483/m2 in 2023, experiencing a growth of +74.76% in just 7 years. In the same period the growth of house priced per m2 in Lisbon as a whole was +117.6%, from €1,875/m2 to €4,080/m2.
Of the 1,900 residential buildings listed in the parish, 4.32% were built before 1919, 6.68% from 1919 to 1960, 44.95% from 1961 to 1990, 20.53% from 1991 to 2000 and 23.53% after 2001. Of the buildings built before 1919 97.56% had 1 to 3 floors, while in buildings built between 1981 and 2010 the proportion of buildings with 6 stories or more is 72.18%. Interestingly, the newer and higher the building the higher the probability of it being served by an elevator. For homes built before 1946, only 0.81% have access to an elevator as of 2021; this percentage ascends to 82.65% for buildings dating from 1981 to 2010. Always with regard to amenities, 30.35% of the houses had access to air conditioning (20.98% in Lisbon), 79.23% to heating (69.62% in Lisbon) and 64.44% to a parking place (28.04% in Lisbon).
As of 2021 there were 2,030 vacant dwelling in the parish. Of the vacant dwellings, 887 are vacant for rental or with the purpose of being sold, while 1,143 are vacant for other reasons, often abandoned, awaiting their demolition or because a reason for conflict among heirs. Moreover, as of 2023 106 apartments are registered as "Alojamento Local", meaning they have the license to be rent on platforms such as Booking.com or Airbnb.
