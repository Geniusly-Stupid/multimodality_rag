The 2013–14 Portland Trail Blazers season was the franchise's 44th season in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
Prior to this season, the Rose Garden was renamed as the Moda Center. The season saw the Blazers improve on their mediocre 2012–13 output, finishing with a 54–28 record, and finishing 5th in the West. After a three-year hiatus, the Blazers returned to the playoffs, facing the Houston Rockets, in the first round, their first meeting since 2009. The Blazers defeated the Rockets in six games, thanks to Damian Lillard's series-clinching three pointer in Game 6 at home, winning their first playoff series since 2000. However, their season ended in the next round with a defeat to the eventual NBA champion San Antonio Spurs in five games.
