Significance of 1901 for software
The date of Friday December 13 20:45:52 1901 is significant for modern computers because it is the earliest date representable with a signed 32-bit integer on systems that reference time in seconds since the Unix epoch. This corresponds to −2147483648 seconds from Thursday January 1 00:00:00 1970. Software that depends on this representation cannot represent an earlier date.
Similarly, many computer systems suffer from the year 2038 problem, when the positive number of seconds since 1970 exceeds 2147483647 (01111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 in binary) and, if represented as a signed 32-bit integer, wraps to −2147483648, representing Friday December 13 20:45:52 1901. In a way, the year 2038 problem for using signed 32-bit integers with January 1, 1970, as the zero date is as the year 2000 problem was for software using two-digit decimal integers with January 1, 1900, as the zero date.
