The 2003 Pan American Games hosted eight different sailing events. Men competed in the Mistral and Laser Standard events. Women also competed in the Mistral event, but they then competed in the Laser Radial event instead of the Laser Standard. There were also four open events this year, which included Sunfish, Snipe, Hobie 16, and J/24. Brazil won the gold medal count and tied Canada for the total medal count in sailing events. Argentina trailed with three total medals while Chile, Mexico, and the United States got two total medals each.
