The 1st Hollywood Critics Association TV Awards, presented by the Hollywood Critics Association, took place through a virtual ceremony on YouTube on August 29, 2021. However, due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County and the US, the ceremony was delayed a week and the broadcast was originally supposed to be held at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles on August 22, 2021.
The nominations were announced via a livestream on July 8, 2021, by Mckenna Grace and Brooklynn Prince on the organization's official YouTube channel. Ted Lasso led the nominations with 8, followed by The Handmaid's Tale and WandaVision with 7 each. Channelwise, HBO and NBC led the nominations with 29 each, followed by Netflix with 28.
The HCA TV Awards also became the first television awards organization to separate streaming programs from broadcast network/cable shows, electing to give the streaming platforms their own separate category in comedy and drama, with the exception of the limited series/tv movie field, which isn't divided by platform.
Ted Lasso won the most awards of the night with four total, followed by The Crown with three.
