Hernán Díaz (Spanish: [eɾˈnan ˈdi.as]; born 1973) is an Argentine-American writer. His 2023 novel, Trust, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. His 2017 novel In the Distance was a finalist for the same Pulitzer Prize, as well as the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. He also received a Whiting Award.

Personal life
Díaz was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. When he was two, his family moved to Sweden after the military coup. His family returned to Argentina after democracy was restored in 1983. Díaz was interested in writing at an early age, and even "pretended" to write, showing his parents his "stories." After obtaining a Licenciate degree in Literature (Licenciatura en Letras) in the University of Buenos Aires, Díaz moved to London to study an MA degree at King's College.
Díaz moved to New York in 1999 for additional studies. He received his PhD from New York University.
He lives in Brooklyn with his wife and daughter.

Career
Díaz is the recipient of the John Updike award from the American Academy of Arts & Letters, given to “a writer whose contributions to American literature have demonstrated consistent excellence." He has received fellowships from the New York Public Library's Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers, the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center, MacDowell, Yaddo, and the Ingmar Bergman Estate.
Díaz has published two novels, which have been published in more than 37 languages. His essays and short stories have been published in The Paris Review, Granta, Playboy, The Yale Review, and McSweeney's.
Borges, Between History and Eternity was published by Continuum on August 2, 2012. The book considers "key aspects of Borges's work — the reciprocal determinations of politics, philosophy and literature; the simultaneously confining and emancipating nature of language; and the incipient program for a literature of the Americas."
In the Distance was published on October 10, 2017 by Coffee House Press. Publishers Weekly, Feminist Press, PANK, and The Paris Review named it one of the top books of 2017, and Literary Hub named it one of "The 20 Best Novels of the Decade".
He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2022, and in 2019, he won a Whiting Award, which is provided "based on the criteria of early-career achievement and the promise of superior literary work to come."
Trust was published by Riverhead Books on May 3, 2022. It received the 2022 Kirkus Prize and 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and it was longlisted for the 2022 Booker Prize.
