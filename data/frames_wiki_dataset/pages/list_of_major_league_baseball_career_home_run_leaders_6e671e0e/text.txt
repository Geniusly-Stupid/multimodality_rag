This is a list of the 300 Major League Baseball players who have hit the most career home runs in regular season play (i.e., excluding playoffs or exhibition games). 
In the sport of baseball, a home run is a hit in which the batter scores by circling all the bases and reaching home plate in one play, without the benefit of a fielding error. This can be accomplished either by hitting the ball out of play while it is still in fair territory (a conventional home run) or by an inside-the-park home run.
Barry Bonds holds the Major League Baseball home run record with 762. He passed Hank Aaron, who hit 755, on August 7, 2007. The only other players to have hit 700 or more are Babe Ruth with 714, and Albert Pujols with 703. Alex Rodriguez (696), Willie Mays (660), Ken Griffey Jr. (630), Jim Thome (612), and Sammy Sosa (609) are the only other players to have hit 600 or more. 
Giancarlo Stanton is the active home run leader and currently 40th all-time with 453.
Players in bold face are active as of the 2026 Major League Baseball season (including free agents), with the number in parentheses designating the number of home runs they have hit during the 2026 season. The last change in the cutoff for the top 300 occurred on September 28, 2025 when Rafael Devers hit his 234th career home run, tying Carlos González, Gary Matthews, Kevin Mitchell, and Paul Molitor.
