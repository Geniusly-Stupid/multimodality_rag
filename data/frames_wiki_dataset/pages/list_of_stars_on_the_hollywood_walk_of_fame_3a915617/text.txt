The following list includes the names, locations, and categories of all the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The categories are motion pictures, television, recording, radio, live performance, and sports entertainment. The list does not include a star's name until his or her award ceremony has taken place, not at the time of nomination or an accepted nomination.
The stars are ordered alphabetically by surname, and all names are shown as they appear on the stars. A performer can have more than one star, recognising their separate achievements in more than one category. While the first seven honorees received their temporary stars in 1958, the list had grown by February 8, 1960, when the first 1,563 permanent stars were placed in the sidewalks along Hollywood Boulevard, already including 199 performers with repeat recognitions, such as the first three (of four) stars for Bob Hope and the first four (of five) stars for Gene Autry. All entries can be found on the Hollywood Walk of Fame website maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce (see the External links section below). As of 3 November 2025, with a ceremony honoring Sherri Shepherd, there are 2,827 stars embedded along the boulevard.
