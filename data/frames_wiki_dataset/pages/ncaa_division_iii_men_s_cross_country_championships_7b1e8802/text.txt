The NCAA Division III men's cross country championships are contested at an annual meet hosted by the NCAA to determine the individual and team national champions of men's collegiate cross country running among its Division III members in the United States. It has been held every fall, usually in November, since the NCAA split into its current three-division format in 1973.
North Central (IL) have been the most successful program, with 19 national titles.
The current champions are Wisconsin-La Crosse, who won their fourth national title in 2024.
