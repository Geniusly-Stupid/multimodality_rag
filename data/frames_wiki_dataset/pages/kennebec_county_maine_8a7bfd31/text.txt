The larger, southern portion of the county is in the 1st Congressional District, while the northern, smaller portion is in the 2nd Congressional District. While the more rural areas support the Republican Party, the urban areas are strongly Democratic.
Historically, the county was more Democratic-leaning than the rest of the state in presidential elections. Kennebec County had consistently voted for Democrats in recent elections, until 2016 when it voted for Republican Donald Trump, the first time it had voted Republican since 1988. The county voted for Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 even as Republican Wendell Willkie narrowly carried Maine, and it voted for Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976 as Republican Gerald Ford also narrowly won the state. In more recent elections, the county voted in-line with the state, voting for the statewide winner in every election from 1980 to 2012. In 2020, it was the closest county in the state, with Democrat Joe Biden defeating Trump by just 181 votes. Kennebec swung back into the Republican column in 2024, with Trump carrying the county this time with a full majority.
