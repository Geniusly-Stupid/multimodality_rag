History
Founded as Dade County Junior College in 1960, MDC began on a high school farm and became desegregated in 1962, opening its doors to students of all races. Over the decades, MDC expanded by launching several campuses, including Kendall, Wolfson, and Hialeah, and established a Medical Center to support students in health programs.
In 1973, the college changed its name to Miami-Dade Community College.
During the 1980s, outreach programs were developed to assist the increasing number of Cuban exiles and other immigrants. As state education budgets declined, MDC continued to grow and relied on its foundation to support operations.
In the 1990s and 2000s, the college established its Honors College, offering rigorous academic programs across its largest campuses. In 2000, the college was sanctioned by the American Association of University Professors "for infringement of governance standards".
In 2003, the college changed its name to "Miami Dade College" and began offering four-year degree programs.

Miami Dade College operates eight campuses and two outreach centers throughout Miami-Dade County.

Academics
MDC offers a wide variety of associate and baccalaureate degrees, as well as vocational and technical certificates. The college is known for its strong programs in liberal arts, nursing, business, allied health professions, and computer information systems.

The Honors College provides scholarships and specialized curricula for high-achieving students, with opportunities for transfer to prestigious universities, including a partnership with the University of Miami. Dual-enrollment and virtual learning options are available for high school and home-educated students.

Athletics
MDC participates in the Southern Conference of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and competes in five sports: men's and women's basketball, baseball, softball, and volleyball, with soccer teams being added in 2024. MDC teams have won 35 NJCAA national titles, making it a hub for talented athletes and MLB scouts. During its early history, the north campus gymnasium area also hosted the Miami Floridians (later known simply as The Floridians) ABA franchise; it hosted five playoff games (April 6, 1971, April 8, 1971, April 12, 1971, and April 4, 1972 & April 6, 1972) before the franchise folded in 1972.
