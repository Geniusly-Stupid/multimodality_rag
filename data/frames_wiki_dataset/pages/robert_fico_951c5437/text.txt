Robert Fico (Slovak: [ˈrɔbert ˈfitsɔ]; born 15 September 1964) is a Slovak politician and lawyer who has served as the prime minister of Slovakia since 2023. Fico holds the distinction as the longest-serving prime minister in the country's history. His collective time in power spans over 12 years across four distinct mandates (2006–2010, 2012–2016, 2016–2018, and the current one since 2023). He founded the left-wing political party Direction – Social Democracy in 1999 and has led the party since. His political positions have been described as populist, left-wing and conservative. 
First elected to parliament in 1992, he was appointed the following year to the Czechoslovak delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Following his party's victory in the 2006 parliamentary election, he formed his first Cabinet. After the 2010 parliamentary election, Fico served as an opposition member of parliament, effectively holding the position of the leader of the opposition. Following a motion of no confidence against the Iveta Radičová cabinet, Fico was re-appointed prime minister after leading Direction – Social Democracy to a landslide election victory in the 2012 parliamentary election, winning 83 seats and forming a government with an absolute majority in Parliament, the first such since 1989. In 2013, Fico declared his candidacy for the 2014 presidential election, but ultimately lost to his political rival Andrej Kiska in the second round of voting on March 29, 2014.
Fico began his third term as prime minister after Direction – Social Democracy won a plurality of the vote in the 2016 parliamentary election, subsequently forming a new coalition government. In March 2018, owing to the political crisis following the murder of Ján Kuciak, Fico delivered his resignation to Kiska, who then charged Deputy Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini with the formation of a new government. Following the 2023 parliamentary election, Fico's party won 22.95% of the vote and 42 seats, becoming the largest party. Fico formed a coalition with Voice – Social Democracy, and with the Slovak National Party, and began his fourth term as prime minister on 25 October.

Early life and education
Fico was born on 15 September 1964 in the town of Topoľčany, northwestern Nitra Region in Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. His father, Ľudovit Fico, was a forklift operator, and his mother, Emilie Ficová, worked in a shoe store. He has two siblings. His brother Ladislav is a construction entrepreneur, and his sister Lucia Chabadová, who is fourteen years younger, is a prosecutor. Fico grew up and lived with his family in the village of Hrušovany, until the age of six, when they moved to the nearby town of Topoľčany.
Fico has described his childhood ambitions as wanting to become either a politician, a sports reporter, or an archaeologist. After completing elementary school, he enrolled in the local Gymnasium of Topoľčany, graduating in the summer of 1982. Later the same year, he enrolled in the Law Faculty of the Comenius University in Bratislava. His teachers were impressed with him, and one of his teachers from university, the future prime minister Jozef Moravčík, described him as "ambitious, very confident, and very involved in discussions." He graduated as a juris doctor in 1986, specializing in criminal law.
After graduating from university, Fico completed his mandatory military service as an assistant military investigator, stationed in the now-Czech town of Janovice, between 1986 and 1987. He later worked for the Institute of State and Law of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, as well as with the Justice Ministry until 1992. During this period, he wrote and completed his PhD degree, with a thesis on "The death penalty in Czechoslovakia". In the early 1990s, he undertook studies at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London under a Masaryk scholarship. In 2002, he completed his postgraduate study, earning him the title of associate professor.

Early career (1992–2006)
Fico joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1986, having applied in 1984. After the Velvet Revolution of 1989, and the collapse of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia, Fico joined the Party of the Democratic Left (SDĽ), a successor of the Communist Party of Slovakia. He was first elected as a member of parliament in 1992. From 1994 to 2000 Fico represented Slovakia as its legal counsel at the European Court of Human Rights but lost all 14 cases which he handled. In 1998, he was elected deputy chairman of the party. Later in 1998, Fico ran for the post of general prosecutor; his party endorsed another candidate instead, arguing that Fico was too young.
In the 1998 elections that saw the fall of the government of Vladimír Mečiar, Fico received the biggest number of preferential votes among his party colleagues. A year later, when support for the SDĽ dropped below the threshold required to get into parliament, he left the party, saying he was disappointed with the way the government worked. As early as the autumn of 1998, a four-person group consisting of Fico, his associate Frantisek Határ, political strategist Fedor Flašík, and media executive Monika Flašíková-Beňová had begun to discuss and lay plans for launching a new political party. These plans were driven by the falling popularity of the existing parties and the rising popularity of Fico.
Almost immediately after leaving SDĽ, the group founded Direction (SMER), which Fico first labelled a party of the third way, with himself as leader. Fico established himself as an opposition politician, criticizing the unpopular reforms of the right-wing government of Mikuláš Dzurinda. To keep SMER from repeating the fate of his previous party, Fico introduced a strict set of regulations for his new party, called the "clean hands" policy. The rules stipulated that no one with ties to the previous Communist regime or people who had a background with other political parties was allowed to hold party office. This created a new generation of politicians uninvolved in previous corruption scandals; among them was Monika Flašíková-Beňová, Robert Kaliňák, and Pavol Paška. Another rule was that all party chapters on the regional and local levels were to be 100% financially self-sufficient, and all financial donations were to be made public to the media.
Between 2002 and 2006, Direction – Social Democracy was the main opposition party in the Slovak parliament. In 2004, it merged with nearly all the leftist parties active on the Slovak political scene, including its parent party SDĽ, becoming the single most dominant political party in Slovakia.

First premiership (2006–2010)
In the 2006 Slovak parliamentary election, the Direction – Social Democracy party secured a victory, winning 50 seats and 29.1% of the vote. A significant factor in this success was Fico's criticism of the previous right-wing government's economic, tax, social, pension, and legislative reforms. These reforms had been endorsed by international bodies, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the OECD. Fico promised to reverse several deeply unpopular austerity measures that had been implemented in the healthcare and education sectors under the previous administration, specifically associated with ministers Rudolf Zajac and Martin Fronc.
Following the election, Direction – Social Democracy successfully formed a coalition government. This government included Vladimír Mečiar's People's Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS), led by Ján Slota. The SNS is a right-wing populist party whose leadership has been known for making anti-Roma and anti-Hungarian remarks. These included a drunken public speech by Slota, in which he threatened to "get in tanks and level Budapest to the ground".
The inclusion of SNS immediately created strain in Slovakia's international relations. During this period, relations with neighboring Hungary deteriorated. A series of scheduled meetings between the Slovak and Hungarian prime ministers were cancelled or postponed, and those that did occur yielded minimal progress in improving the bilateral relationship.

Coalition crisis
On 10 April 2007, the deputy director of the Slovak Land Fund and HZDS nominee Branislav Bríza signed a contract based on which restitutors from eastern Slovakia became the owners of lucrative land in the Tatra village of Veľký Slavkov. These restitutors then quickly sold the land to the company GVM for 13 million Slovak crowns (Slovak currency before euro). The figurehead of the company was a friend of Mečiar, Milan Bališ. Bríza did so while his boss Hideghéty was on vacation. 10 April was the last day when Bríza had full power acting on behalf of his boss in the absence of his boss. This was the seventh suspicious contract he had signed up for at that point. 
Such practices were previously criticized by Fico as they were common during the tenure of his Coalition partner, HDZS leader Mečiar. This scandal almost led to the collapse of the Coalition. It led to the Minister of Agriculture for HDZS, Miroslav Jureňa, resigning. Fico demanded that Bríza resign. The estimated damage to the state was half a billion Slovak crowns. Justice was delivered on 8 September 2015 when Bríza was deemed guilty and sentenced to 2 years' probation.

Schengen Area
Slovakia joined the Schengen Area, which abolished checks at internal borders with fellow member states, on December 21, 2007.
The successful accession was seen as a major achievement of the country's post-communist integration into European structures. At the time, Fico and his government strongly insisted on the planned 2007 accession date, pushing back against suggestions from some older EU members to delay the enlargement until 2008 or 2009. Fico celebrated the event, declaring that Slovakia had achieved a key strategic goal alongside EU membership and likened Schengen accession to the significance of the year 1989. 
In 2015, Fico was a vocal proponent of strengthening the Schengen Area's external borders, particularly during the European migrant crisis. He criticized the reintroduction of internal border controls as a potential threat to the EU's free movement principle.

Party of European Socialists
Fico's political party, Direction – Social Democracy, was first accepted into the Party of European Socialists (PES) as a provisional member. The PES suspended the party in October 2006 after it formed a government coalition with the nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS).
The party's provisional membership was restored on February 14, 2008, after Direction–Social Democracy and the Slovak National Party signed a letter committing themselves to respect minority rights and European values. Fico achieved full membership in the PES on December 8, 2009, at the European Socialist Congress in Prague.

Global financial crisis
Slovakia was hit extremely hard by the 2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent recession due to its highly open and export-dependent economy. The main impact came not from a domestic banking crisis, but from the collapse of foreign demand for its industrial products, particularly cars and electronics. After enjoying exceptionally high GDP growth in the preceding years, the country experienced a dramatic contraction in 2009, suffering one of the steepest economic declines among developed nations. This immediate and sharp downturn was a direct result of the plunging export volumes to key trading partners, especially Germany.
In response, the Fico cabinet announced several crisis packages in early 2009, including a commitment of funds to support businesses and the introduction of more flexible labor legislation, while aiming to avoid significantly increasing the budget deficit. Fico's focus during this time was on preserving employment and maintaining economic stability amid the global recession.
A crucial mitigating factor was the country's successful entry into the Eurozone on January 1, 2009. This provided a stable currency anchor, shielding Slovakia from the severe exchange rate volatility and financial panic that affected non-Eurozone neighbors like Hungary and Poland. Despite this stability, the real economy saw mass lay-offs and a severe slowdown in its major production sectors. In essence, while the financial system was protected by joining the euro, the industrial economy was severely battered by the collapse in global trade.

Introduction of the Euro
During the 2008 global financial crisis, Fico led the government's most significant achievement: successfully bringing the country into the Eurozone on January 1, 2009, becoming the 16th member of the Eurozone. This move was the completion of a process that had been started by the previous administration.
Slovakia's successful adherence to the Maastricht criteria—resulting in a relatively balanced budget and low public debt—is widely credited with helping the country withstand the initial shock better than many neighbors. However, as a small, highly open, and export-dependent economy, Slovakia was still severely impacted by a sharp drop in foreign demand, forcing the government to repeatedly slash its GDP growth forecasts.
Fico publicly championed the euro, viewing it as a vital strategic move to solidify the country's economic stability. He often emphasized that joining the Eurozone would be a major advantage, especially since it occurred during the height of the global financial crisis, arguing the euro would serve as a "protective shield".
On the day of the changeover from the Slovak koruna, Fico made a symbolic withdrawal of euros from an ATM. He was quoted as stating: "We are very happy in Slovakia because we believe that Europe will be a big success for Slovakia. Of course, we are also happy because we are going to introduce the euro at a time of deep economic crisis and Europe can be very helpful for us". He stated that the euro would "attract investors to Slovakia" and "stabilize Slovakia as a whole". He added, "The euro has come to Slovakia on New Year's Day 2009 as the best talisman one can imagine”. The introduction of the euro under Fico's premiership was seen as a key step in integration into the core of the European Union.

Slovak–Ukraine gas dispute (2009)
The 2009 Russia-Ukraine gas dispute created a severe energy crisis for Slovakia. When all Russian gas flow through Ukraine was stopped on January 7, 2009, Slovakia, along with other Central and Eastern European nations, was among the most heavily affected, forcing the Slovak government to immediately declare a state of emergency.
Faced with dwindling domestic reserves that could only cover industrial and household needs for a short period, Fico personally traveled to Kyiv to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart, Yulia Tymoshenko, to demand an immediate resolution. Fico later visited Moscow where he said Ukraine  was "losing the trust of European partners because of its behaviour".
As a desperate measure, Fico suggested that the government might need to resort to the "non-standard solution" of restarting the decommissioned second block of the Jaslovské Bohunice nuclear power plant to generate necessary electricity. The crisis was resolved on January 18 and Slovakia ended its state of emergency on January 20.

Truckers blockade
In January 2010, Fico's government faced large-scale protests and a blockade of major cities by truckers, organized primarily by the Union of Road Transporters (UNAS). The protests were a strong demonstration of public opposition against the new electronic highway toll collection system launched on January 1, 2010. Truckers blockaded thoroughfares, demanding that fuel prices be lowered to offset the impact of the new tolls.
Fico initially refused to negotiate, stating he would not be "blackmailed," and constitutional officials, including Fico, condemned the media and opposition for allegedly supporting the law-breaking activities. Ultimately, after massive pressure, Fico yielded to the truckers' demands on January 11, promising to lower the excise tax on diesel fuel.

Leaked voice recording
Shortly before the 2010 general election a voice recording, allegedly featuring a voice highly resembling Fico's, was published by the newspaper Sme on its website. In the recording, the speaker discussed potentially securing several million euros in undeclared funds for the 2002 election campaign and suggested establishing a "parallel financial structure" to support Direction – Social Democracy's future election endeavors.
Slovak media outlets covered the recording and its implications. Fico officially dismissed the recording, stating it was a forgery. Fico's reaction to the media outlets publishing this information was expressed in vulgar terms, stating: "The fact that you're all going to masturbate over this now—I hope you have a pleasant sexual experience".
The newspaper Sme later wrote that Fico had been questioned by the police concerning the matter. Former Minister of Justice Daniel Lipšic informed the press that he had officially submitted the recording to the General Attorney's Office for review.

Leader of the Opposition (2010–2012)
In the 2010 Slovak parliamentary election, Fico's Direction – Social Democracy finished as the strongest party, securing a significant victory with 34.8% of the vote and 62 seats—an increase of 12 seats from the previous election. Despite this plurality, Fico faced a substantial setback in its ability to govern. Fico’s coalition partners suffered crippling losses; the People's Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia failed to cross the 5% threshold, being shut out of parliament entirely, while the Slovak National Party was reduced to just 9 seats. This decimation meant that the leftist coalition, which had governed since 2006, could no longer command a majority in the 150-seat National Council, reaching only 71 seats. 
Although President Ivan Gašparovič initially tasked Fico with forming the new cabinet as the leader of the largest party, he was unable to secure a parliamentary majority due to the firm refusal of all other parties to join a government with him. Consequently, the government formation mandate passed to the centre-right, which coalesced around a four-party agreement. Fico said he "respects the election result" and expressed his desire to lead a resolute opposition.

Second premiership (2012–2016)
Following the fall of the centre-right coalition government, Fico's Direction – Social Democracy party returned to power in the 2012 parliamentary election.
Direction – Social Democracy secured 44.42% of the popular vote, which resulted in 83 out of 150 seats in the National Council. This outcome marked a significant electoral event, as Direction – Social Democracy became the first single party since the breakup of Czechoslovakia to win an absolute majority of seats.
Fico initially sought to form a national unity government with parties such as SDKÚ-DS or KDH. When these coalition efforts were unsuccessful, Direction – Social Democracy proceeded to form the first one-party government in Slovakia since 1993.

Candidacy for President
On 18 December 2013, Fico officially announced his candidacy for the upcoming 2014 presidential election. He said: "I understand my candidacy as a service to Slovakia." He argued that he did not see his candidacy as an adventure, an escape, or an attempt to culminate his political career. His campaign ran under the motto "Ready for Slovakia". On 9 January 2014, the Slovak Parliament, under Speaker Pavol Paška, officially approved the candidatures of Fico and 14 other candidates. Fico was defeated by the independent candidate Andrej Kiska, whose support from the Slovak right wing led him to victory by a wide margin (approximately 59%–41%) in the second round of voting on 29 March 2014.

European migrant crisis
The 2015 European migrant crisis fundamentally shaped Fico's political platform, driving him to adopt an explicit, hardline anti-imigration stance. He opposed the EU's mandatory quota mechanism designed to redistribute 120,000 asylum seekers across member states from   Greece and Italy. Fico described the EU's migration policy was a "ritual suicide" for the bloc and said that Slovakia would "never" accept the quotas. His government filed a lawsuit against the European Union at the European Court of Justice in December 2015, challenging the legality of the quota decision.
Fico's described the crisis as a major security threat, stating that Muslims in his  government was "monitoring" the Muslim community after the November 2015 Paris attacks. He said that Slovakia would prefer to accept only Christian refugees and that it would be impossible to integrate Muslim communities into Slovakia's predominantly Catholic society. His strong focus on border protection and his nationalist, anti-immigrant campaign was highly effective, helping his Direction – Social Democracy party secure a victory in the March 2016 general election.

Third premiership (2016–2018)
Following the 2016 parliamentary elections, Fico's party, Direction – Social Democracy, secured a plurality, obtaining 49 seats and 28.3% of the vote, though it did not achieve a majority.
Fico was tasked with forming a viable governing coalition, a process he concluded on March 17 with the announcement of a four-party government. The composition of this coalition was particularly notable due to the inclusion of two groups previously regarded as ideological antagonists: the nationalist Slovak National Party and Most–Híd, a party focused on cooperation with the ethnic Hungarian minority.
The resulting four-party government coalition, composed of Direction – Social Democracy, the Slovak National Party, Most–Híd, and Network, was sworn into office on March 23, 2016.

EU Council Presidency
Fico led Slovakia during its first-ever Presidency of the Council of the European Union, which spanned the second half of 2016 following the Brexit referendum. In his address, Fico said that EU citizens must be at the heart of the Union's future agenda and called for the EU to be less "elitist", framing the bloc's future in terms of "openness, honesty, and simplicity". 
The presidency's biggest event was the informal Bratislava Summit of the EU-27, first major meeting of EU leaders without the United Kingdom following the Brexit referendum. Its purpose was to diagnose the EU's challenges together and begin the political process of defining its future. 
Te Slovak Presidency was generally seen by EU officials as a successful and well-managed one, efficiently delivering on a heavy legislative agenda. Among the tangible achievements under Fico’s leadership were the launch of the European Border and Coast Guard (Frontex), the finalization of the EU-Canada trade deal (CETA), and the adoption of the 2017 EU budget.
Based on its opposition to mandatory refugee quotas, the Slovak Presidency's main success in the migration debate was the successful introduction of "effective solidarity" at the Bratislava Summit. This concept was championed by Fico to offer a flexible alternative to relocation, allowing EU member states to contribute to migration management through financial aid, equipment, or border assistance—a diplomatic victory that helped shift the EU focus toward strengthening external border control.

Brexit
Fico stated that Brexit would be painful for Britain. He said that the European Union must emerge more successful from the negotiations to prevent Brexit from becoming an example for other countries to follow. In an interview, he said, "It will be very difficult for the UK, very difficult". He said the EU's strategy was to "take this opportunity to show the public: 'listen guys, now you will see why it is important to stay in the EU.' This will be the position".
Fico dismissed the UK's confidence in the negotiations as a "bluff". He said that the EU will not allow Britain to "cherry-pick" benefits like the Single Market without accepting the corresponding obligations, including the treatment of EU workers and the free movement of people. In November 2016, Fico stated that the United Kingdom "must suffer" more than the 27 countries that would remain in the bloc.

Murder of Ján Kuciak
The murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kušnírová in February 2018 sent shockwaves through Slovakia and immediately ignited a political crisis for the government led by Fico. Kuciak's final, posthumously published article detailed alleged links between high-ranking Slovak state officials and Italian businessmen with ties to organized crime, including the Italian mafia 'Ndrangheta. The article mentioned Mária Trošková, an assistant to Fico, and Viliam Jasaň, Secretary of the National Security Council, as having connections to one of the Italian businessmen. Kuciak alleged that Slovakian businessmen, who had links to the Calabrian mafia, were embezzling EU structural funds.
Fico responded by offering €1 million for information leading to the murderers, displaying packs of cash during a press conference with the Interior Minister and Police President. He also warned against the "political abuse of a tragedy". The investigation into the murder later led to the accusation that prominent businessman Marián Kočner—a frequent subject of Kuciak's investigative work and a figure reported to have links to Fico's Direction – Social Democracy party—had ordered the hit. The revelations, combined with the public's view that the government was failing to tackle corruption, triggered the largest anti-government street protests in Slovakia since the 1989 Velvet Revolution, demanding Fico's resignation, eventually forcing him and his entire cabinet to step down in March 2018.

George Soros
In March 2018, following the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and the resulting mass anti-government protests, Fico publicly accused President Andrej Kiska of colluding with American-Hungarian financier and philanthropist George Soros to destabilize Slovakia and bring down his administration.
Fico cited a private meeting between Kiska and Soros in New York in September 2017 as evidence that the President's subsequent call for government reconstruction or early elections was driven by foreign influence. Soros's Open Society Foundations rejected the claims, stating that the meeting with President Kiska had been focused on humanitarian topics such as the integration of the Roma community and that Soros played no role in the protests or political crisis.
At a press conference on March 5, 2018, Fico said, "I want to pose a simple question to Mr. President. On 20 September 2017 in New York, on 5th Avenue, I am asking, why the Head of State would pay a visit on private soil to a person, who has questionable reputation and this person's name is George Soros".
Fico asked why Kiska did not take a representative of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to the meeting, suggesting this proved the meeting was nefarious. Fico then directly linked the meeting to the political fallout, stating that "What happened after the murder of the journalists suggest that there is an attempt in this country for a total destabilisation," thereby accusing Soros of attempting to overthrow his democratically elected government.
Fico's accusation mirrored that of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who had accused Soros of interfering in Hungarian politics. Fico said Kiska's call for government changes was not "written in Slovakia," but was guided by Soros, suggesting a coup was being plotted against him.

Resignation
On 14 March 2018, Fico publicly stated that he was ready to tender his resignation as prime minister in order to avoid a snap election, as well as to "solve the political crisis" involving the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak.
Fico's announcement came after a meeting with President Kiska. In that meeting, Fico laid out several specific conditions that needed to be met by the president for him to resign. Those conditions were, amongst others, that the result of the 2016 Slovak parliamentary election be respected, that the current ruling government coalition must continue, and that Direction – Social Democracy, as the largest party currently in parliament, name the next prime minister. Fico stated that he already had a candidate in mind. Slovak media widely reported that the next prime minister would be Deputy Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini. On 15 March, President Kiska formally accepted the resignation of prime minister Fico and his cabinet, and thereby tasked Pellegrini with forming a new government.
Upon tendering his resignation, Fico declared, “I told the president: 'You can relax, I'm not leaving politics, I want to be an active party leader.'" He also stated, “I'm sure that a decision to create a new government is the right step. An early election would not bring any stability.” This maneuver allowed the existing three-party ruling coalition to remain in power.

Political wilderness (2018–2023)
Following his 2018 resignation, Fico entered the political wilderness for several years. Despite stepping down as prime minister, he maintained an active role as leader of his party. Direction – Social Democracy remained in power until the 2020 parliamentary elections, where they finished second with 18.29% of the vote and 38 seats, and consequently lost the ability to form a government.
During his time in opposition, Fico actively prepared for a return to power, often using aggressive and polarizing rhetoric against his opponents. Amidst this political turmoil, he issued the statement, “God – we will drive them out (…) not even an oily spot will remain (after them),” promising retribution against those he considered political enemies.

Candidacy for Judge
Fico's failed attempt to become a Constitutional Court judge took place in early 2019, less than a year after his resignation as prime minister. He was among the candidates nominated to replace nine outgoing judges, with reports suggesting he aspired to chair the Court. His candidacy faced significant opposition, particularly concerning his legal experience, as critics questioned whether he met the required 15 years of practice. Fico withdrew his candidacy after his coalition partner, the Most-Hid political party, refused to support him.

COVID-19 pandemic
Fico entered opposition after the 2020 parliamentary election. The new government mismanaged the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In early 2021, Slovakia had one of the highest hospitalisation and death rates per million inhabitants among European countries. Fico was detained by police in December 2021 for organising an anti-government rally which breached Slovakia's lockdown rules. Fico opposed mandatory vaccinations, which he called a "disgusting fascist idea". He claimed that influenza was more dangerous than COVID-19.
In July 2022, the think tank Visegrad Insight described Fico as one of the "most important individual disseminators of politically motivated disinformation and conspiratorial content".
According to media outlet VSquare, Fico capitalised on the political chaos and mismanagement of the government between 2020 and 2023. His uncompromising opposition to the pandemic response proved to be a key element in the resuscitation of his political support, ultimately paving the way for his party's victory in the 2023 parliamentary elections.

Criminal charges
In April 2022, the National Criminal Agency (NAKA) launched "Operation Súmrak" (Twilight), charging opposition leader and former prime minister Robert Fico.
The charges leveled against Fico and his former Interior Minister, Robert Kaliňák, were severe, alleging they had established and led an criminal group while in power, in addition to abuse of authority and improperly handling confidential tax information.
Fico said the charges were a "political vendetta" and an act of "fascism".
As a sitting Member of Parliament, Fico was protected by constitutional immunity from detention, necessitating a formal police request to the National Council to waive this privilege. Despite the government's anti-corruption mandate, the parliament's vote in May 2022 failed to gather the requisite 76 votes (a constitutional majority) to waive Fico's parliamentary immunity. Kaliňák, who did not enjoy MP privileges, had already been taken into custody. On May 13, 2022, the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic ruled to release Kaliňák from pre-trial custody.
The charges against both Fico and Kaliňák were nullified in November 2022 by the General Prosecutor's Office under Article 363 of the Criminal Procedure Code, citing various procedural and legal errors in the original investigation.

Attacks against the President
Fico's rhetoric against Slovak president Zuzana Čaputová became a defining feature of Slovakia's deeply polarized political landscape, particularly as he sought to return to power. The attacks centered on attempts to delegitimize her mandate and pro-Western stance by consistently labeling her as a "US puppet," an "American agent," or an accomplice of the foreign financier George Soros, entirely without evidence. Fico and his Direction – Social Democracy allies aimed to portray the progressive, liberal president as disloyal to national interests and controlled by external forces.
While Fico himself used slightly less vulgar terms in public addresses, his political environment—including high-profile party members—openly embraced and incited crowds to use far more extreme, misogynistic insults, such as the highly offensive phrase "americká kurva" (American whore) at rallies. The constant and aggressive nature of this verbal abuse, which included death threats directed at Čaputová and her family, significantly contributed to the toxic political atmosphere in Slovakia. Ultimately, Čaputová cited the escalating hatred and threats as a primary reason for her 2023 decision not to seek a second term as president.

Russian invasion of Ukraine
During the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while serving in opposition from 2022 to his return to power in October 2023, Fico adopted an increasingly strong pro-Russian and anti-Ukraine aid position. A central part of his campaign platform was the pledge to immediately halt the provision of further military aid from Slovak army stocks to Ukraine, declaring that Slovakia would not send "a single round of ammunition".
Fico repeated Russian propaganda narratives, that the war started in 2014 when "Ukrainian Nazis and fascists started to murder the Russian citizens in Donbas and Luhansk". He repeatedly criticized the EU and NATO's strategy, arguing that sanctions against Russia were ineffective and only harmed the Slovak economy.
Fico used the German phrase "über alles" (above all), when describing Germany's foreign policy. The phrase appeared in Nazi Germany’s national anthem. He had previously compared the German army to a Nazi-era Wehrmacht when discussing the possibility that German troops would be deployed in Slovakia as part of NATO collective defense. He advocated for a diplomatic resolution, though he acknowledged that Ukraine would likely have to cede some territory to Russia to achieve peace. The issue of support for Ukraine became a highly polarizing topic in the lead-up to the snap parliamentary election.

Fourth premiership (2023–present)
Following the parliamentary election, Fico's Direction – Social Democracy secured 22.95% of the vote and 42 seats, establishing itself as the largest political party. 
Fico then formed a governing coalition by reaching an agreement with the Voice – Social Democracy (Hlas), a party founded in 2020, led by Peter Pellegrini and other dissidents of Fico's Smer, and the nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS), led by Andrej Danko, thereby bringing the SNS back into government after a three-year absence from the National Council of Slovakia. This coalition formalized Fico's return to the premiership, and his Fourth Cabinet was officially sworn into power on 25 October 2023.

Greater control of the media
In late 2023, the government began its campaign by publicly labeling several leading independent outlets as "hostile media" and threatened to restrict their access to government offices. The government cut the public broadcaster's budget at the start of 2024. In March 2024, the government's announced a plan to replace the public broadcaster Radio and Television of Slovakia (RTVS). This was condemned as an attack on press freedom and sparked protests. Noel Curran, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) director general, said in a statement that "This appears to be a thinly veiled attempt to turn the Slovak public service broadcaster into state-controlled media". Critics, including President Zuzana Čaputová, local journalists, the opposition, international media groups, and the European Commission, warned the move gave the government full control of Slovak public television and radio. 
In mid-2024 the government passed a law that dissolved RTVS and replaced it with a new entity, Slovak Television and Radio (STVR), controlled by a government-appointed council. The International Press Institute (IPI) said the move allowed the ruling coalition to install its own leadership and exert greater political control over public media content. The Democratic Erosion Consortium said in April 2025 that the replacement of RTVS has drawn international criticism and raised concerns about democratic backsliding and media freedom in the country.
A report by IPI in June 2025, said pressure was applied to most popular private television Markíza, leading to staff changes and fears of editorial self-censorship.

Judiciary and criminal code reforms
Fico's ruling coalition passed a law that shut down the Special Prosecutor's Office, which had dealt with serious corruption. Investigations by the office had led to many high-profile corruption cases and convictions, many of them involving Fico's MPs, party members, and business partners. The changes also include a reduction in punishment for corruption. The ruling coalition fast-tracked the amendments through parliament, limiting the time for debate and preventing the draft law from being reviewed by experts and others usually involved in the process. The changes were opposed by the Slovak president and opposition, and sparked large protests in Slovakia.
In 2024, Fico's coalition passed an Amendment to the Criminal Code. This amendment reduced sentences and statutes of limitations for numerous criminal acts, among them bribery, tax fraud, fraud, embezzlement and robbery. This reform stopped the prosecution of some corruption cases involving politicians and businessmen, some of whom were close to Fico. Among them were: former minister of finance Ján Počiatek; Oligarch Jozef Výboh, suspected of taking a bribe of 150,000 €, intended for Peter Pellegrini; and acting speaker of the National Council Peter Žiga, suspected of an attempt to bribe a Supreme Court judge with 100,000 €.

Assassination attempt
On 15 May 2024, around 14:30 (2:30 PM), Fico was injured in a shooting in Handlová, Slovakia, in front of the city's House of Culture after a government meeting, and was subsequently hospitalized at the F.D. Roosevelt Hospital in Banská Bystrica. A 71-year-old poet named Juraj Cintula was immediately detained by police as a primary suspect. Fico was reportedly in a "life-threatening" condition following the attack, having suffered wounds to his stomach, arms, and legs but was stabilized following emergency surgery, and was expected to recover according to deputy prime minister Tomáš Taraba. Cintula stated that he was motivated by what he perceived as Fico's anti-EU stance and by the wish for Slovakia to provide "military assistance" to Ukraine. 
On 30 May, Fico was discharged from the hospital and was allowed to continue his recovery at home. 
On 5 June 2024, Fico made his first comments on the attack, saying that he forgave the attacker as he is only the "messenger of evil" of the opposition. Fico asked the "anti-government media", especially those linked to George Soros, foreign-funded NGO's and the opposition, not to downplay the reasons for the attack. He described his attacker as a "messenger of the evil and political hatred" created by the "unsuccessful and frustrated" opposition. He added that he expected to return to work later that month or in July.
Senior politicians from Fico's ruling coalition blamed independent media and the opposition for the assassination attempt, alleging that they influenced the shooter. Slovak journalists and opposition leaders feared that the government would use the assassination attempt to crack down on them. The shooting was unanimously condemned by the National Council.
On 21 October 2025, Cintula was convicted and sentenced to 21 years' imprisonment by the Specialised Criminal Court in Banska Bystrica.

Doctors' strike
At the end of 2024, the government faced a doctors' strike for better conditions. More than 3,300 doctors submitted their resignations. The government passed a bill according to which, when an emergency is declared, doctors can face up to one year in prison or a 1,500€ fine for refusing to work, and up to five years if a patient is harmed as a consequence of their departure. Minister of Health Kamil Šaško considered using emergency measures in districts with the highest resignation rates. Ultimately, the government signed an agreement with the doctors' union with many concessions.

Protests
Fico traveled to Russia on 22 December 2024 to meet with Vladimir Putin to discuss primarily the transfer of Russian gas to Slovakia, becoming the third Western leader to do so since the war started. The meeting violated the terms of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy.
Due to Fico's continued vocal support for Russia and opposition to Ukraine, tens of thousands of people protested throughout Slovakia. Fico had protested Ukraine closing the brotherhood pipeline and attempted to pressure the Ukrainian government into continuing the transit of Russian gas to Slovakia, by stating he would block energy supply to Ukraine. In response the Polish government announced that they would allow the transit of emergency natural gas instead. 
During the January protests, Fico's coalition partners, the SNS, withdrew from his governing coalition, opening the possibility for a vote of no confidence to oust Fico. Fico said the protest organisers and the opposition were colluding with a group of foreigners to bring about a coup in Slovakia. He said the group would occupy government buildings, block roads, organise a nationwide strike, and provoke clashes with police forces as part of their plan. In support of the accusation, he presented to parliament a secret report from Slovakia's security service.

Slovak–Ukraine gas dispute (2025)
The Slovak–Ukraine gas dispute began on January 1, 2025, when Ukraine did not renew the transit contract with Russia's Gazprom, halting the primary flow of Russian natural gas to Central European nations, including Slovakia. Fico vehemently criticized Ukraine's "unilateral decision," arguing that it caused significant economic harm to Slovakia, which stood to lose an estimated €500 million annually in transit fees.
Fico said he was "fed up with" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he accused of "roaming Europe begging and blackmailing others, asking for money." Fico tied his statement to the Slovak-Ukraine gas dispute, and described Ukraine as an unreliable partner.
In direct response, Fico's government threatened to retaliate by cutting electricity supplies and reducing support for Ukrainian refugees. Ukraine, in turn, accused Fico of prioritizing Moscow's interests and offered to help secure alternative, non-Russian energy supplies for Slovakia. However, by February 1, Slovakia's state gas supplier began receiving Russian gas via a new southern route—the TurkStream pipeline through Turkey and Hungary—partially mitigating the immediate supply crisis, though at higher prices and with reduced volumes, forcing Slovakia to seek further diversification.

Open letter from psychiatrists
In January 2025, over 150 Slovak psychiatrists and psychologists signed an open letter to Fico, expressing profound concern about the country's political direction and the state of society. The letter, penned by professors Jozef Hašto and Anton Heretik, accused Fico of being authoritarian, manipulating facts, and "aggressive and emotionally explosive" public speeches, which they suggested worsened after the May 2024 assassination attempt.
The professionals wrote that Fico was fostering a negative atmosphere and polarising the public. Fico said the psychiatrists had "long been public opponents of [his] government" and described the appeal as "a disgraceful abuse of your titles for political purposes".

Croatian property
In March 2025, Croatian media alleged Fico had purchased land in the coastal village of Ražanj and was planning to build a summer house there. Fico dismissed the allegation and said he would readily admit the claim if it were true since "hundreds of Slovak politicians, whether at the national, regional, or local level, own property there".  
In July, The Slovak Spectator wrote that a luxury two-story villa in Croatia, with a pool, sea view and reportedly valued over one million euros, was linked to Fico. The property is not registered under Fico’s name in the Croatian land registry. The property was initially registered to two young Slovak businessmen, Matej Gocník and Matúš Moravčík, both with tangential ties to Fico's political circle. Opposition leader and former Slovak prime minister Igor Matovič alleged that these individuals were "front men" for Fico and that Fico stayed there in 2024. In March, Slovak media had reported that Fico had telephoned the "real owner" to apologise for the "media circus" and to arrange a rental of the villa for his summer holiday. Local authorities reportedly confirmed that the property was not registered for legal rental.

Election meddling accusation
In July 2025, Fico accused the United Kingdom of "deliberate, intentional" interference in the 2023 Slovak parliamentary election. Fico alleged that the UK's Foreign Office, through a London-based media agency, secretly funded a campaign to pay influencers and activists. He claimed the campaign aimed to sway young voters in favour of the liberal opposition party, Progressive Slovakia (PS), and undermine his own party, Direction – Social Democracy.
The allegations, stemming from an investigative report, resulted in the Slovak Foreign Ministry summoning the British Ambassador for an explanation. The UK government firmly rejected the accusation, asserting its activity was non-partisan and only intended to encourage democratic participation among young people.

Constitutional amendments
In September 2025, the government successfully passed an amendment to the Slovak constitution which ensures that male and female are the only recognized genders, limits adoption to married heterosexual couples, and ban surrogacy. The amendment also obliges school curricula to comply with the cultural and ethical positions of the Slovak constitution, including an earlier amendment from 2014 stipulating that marriage can only be between a man and a woman. It also states that Slovak laws regarding cultural and ethical issues override EU laws. Direction – Social Democracy hailed its amendment as "a dam against progressivism" and a necessary measure to uphold "the traditions, the cultural and spiritual heritage of our ancestors".

Expulsion from European Socialists
The Party of European Socialists (PES) officially expelled Fico's party, Direction – Social Democracy, at its congress in October 2025 in Amsterdam. The decision, which was unanimous, followed the party's suspension in October 2023 for forming a government coalition with the far-right Slovak National Party and for a "clear divergence from the values of the PES family". PES did not give specific reasons for the expulsion but said the party had taken positions that contradict "severely and deeply the values and principles our family stands for".
Fico responded to the expulsion with defiance, taking to social media to state he was "proud of this exclusion" if it was due to his party's defense of the constitutional definition of marriage, which in Slovakia enshrines the union as exclusively between a man and a woman, or his participation in the celebration of victory over fascism in Russia and China. He said the PES' action demonstrated intolerance toward his government's social conservatism, and he also stated that "The Party of European Socialists should be renamed the Party of European Homosexuals and Warmongers".

Opposition to sanctions on Russia
Fico opposes sanctions on Russia and has described the EU's policy of ending Russian energy imports as "imbecilic". Slovakia depends heavily on the import of Russian energy and has asked for an exemption from the EU's Russian import policy and requested that Slovakia keep its current contract with Russian gas company Gazprom until it expires in 2034. He said he would not support sanctions against Russia which would hurt Slovakia. The adoption of the 18th package of sanctions was delayed six times until Fico withdrew his opposition in July 2025, after securing written assurances and guarantees from the European Commission regarding energy prices and supply security.
In October 2025, Fico invoked his veto power again to block the 19th package of sanctions, which targets Russian LNG, oil infrastructure, and frozen assets—demanding that EU leaders first provide concrete instructions to address the crisis in the automotive industry and high energy costs. Fico's strategy of linking support for sanctions to domestic economic concerns has positioned Slovakia, alongside Hungary, as an obstacle to European unity on policy towards Russia.
In a speech delivered in the National Council of Slovakia, Fico dismissed the objective to "bring Russia to its knees," and stated that the world knows "Russians only get on their knees to tie their shoelaces".
In November 2025, Fico has stated that Slovakia will not support the European Union's plan to use frozen Russian assets to finance military costs in Ukraine. Fico called the EU initiative controversial, warning that seizing the assets for military aid would only prolong the war, and argued that the focus should be on a peace plan. He emphasized that Slovakia would not participate in any legal or financial schemes directed at using the frozen funds for Ukrainian military spending and stated, "This piece of Russian cheese smells extremely tempting to the European raven".

Ideological views
Fico's ideological views are generally described as populist, combining elements of left-wing nationalism and social conservatism within his Direction – Social Democracy party. While his party identifies as social-democratic, Fico has been noted for his use of anti-establishment rhetoric, often criticizing elites, the media, and non-governmental organizations.
Fico has asserted that liberal democracy has "completely collapsed" and is "terribly ineffective". He praised the governance models of communist countries like China and Vietnam, citing their economic effectiveness and stability as proof that there are superior ways to manage a state than the current Western democratic system.
Economically, his party, champions a leftist platform, advocating for strong social welfare spending and state intervention to support the working class, often by reversing market-oriented and austerity reforms implemented by previous governments. 

Socially, Fico adheres to deeply conservative positions, opposing LGBTQ+ rights and same-sex adoption while promoting policies that emphasize national pride and traditional Christian values.
In foreign policy, he pursues the concept of the "politics of the four corners of the world," which advocates for an autonomous, sovereign approach that balances Slovakia's EU/NATO membership with intensified relations with non-EU partners, including the BRICS bloc. In line with this doctrine he holds pro-Russian views, valuing a friendly relationship with Russia and often sympathising with Russia's geopolitical interests, marking a significant departure from Slovakia's long-standing Western ties.
Fico initially defined Direction – Social Democracy as the "the third way" party, which recognised the role of the market and business as well as the role of government and a strong state. His ideology has undergone transformations over his long career, consistently prioritizing his domestic political goals and emphasizing Slovak national interests. Fico is critical of the Western model of the left, which he calls "the Brussels left".

Fico selectively praises a diverse range of historical Slovak figures to build a broad political narrative rooted in national identity and socialist history. He hailed Ľudovít Štúr, a key figure in the Slovak national revival, stressing that Štúr was guided by the motto that "the most beautiful words are deeds". He expressed respect for Gustáv Husák, the last Communist president of Czechoslovakia, stating Husák "prevented repressions in the normalisation 70s" and deserves "respect and humility". He also invokes Alexander Dubček of the Prague Spring, stating that his own political party is dedicated to providing a "human face to modern society", following Dubček's vision of a "socialism with a human face". Fico also honors Milan Rastislav Štefánik, a co-founder of Czechoslovakia, by calling him a "lasting symbol of inspiration and national pride". He honored Vladimír Clementis, a Communist diplomat and victim of Stalinist purges, by stating his praise and later unveiling a sculpture of him at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2007. Fico has also embraced the legacy of the influential writer and intellectual Vladimír Mináč, attending the unveiling of his bust in 2022 and stating that Mináč was a "left-wing intellectual with a deep national feeling" whose "thoughts are still valid today".
Fico has actively courted and praised Catholic figures like Cardinal Ján Chryzostom Korec, who, in turn, expressed support for him, saying Fico "has all the qualities of a good president" during his 2014 presidential campaign.
Fico has publicly expressed a positive affinity for several international figures, including Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, whom he has called a "friend". He also considers Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán a close ally and a leader who does not fear to openly defend the interests of his people. He holds a positive view of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Fico is a member of the Slovak Matica and supports Slovak Union of Anti-Fascist Fighters.
In 2025, Fico addressed the Conservative Political Action Conferences, which aim to gather conservatives, in the United States in February and in Hungary in May.

Domestic policy
Immigration and Islam
Fico rejected European Commission's plan to distribute refugees and economic migrants from the Middle East and Africa among EU member states, saying: "As long as I am prime minister, mandatory quotas will not be implemented on Slovak territory." He stated that "thousands of terrorists and Islamic State fighters are entering Europe with migrants, and added: "We monitor every single Muslim in Slovakia."
In May 2016, Fico stated that Slovakia would not accept "one single Muslim" migrant into the country, weeks before the country was scheduled to take over the Presidency of the Council of the EU. He further stated: "When I say something now, maybe it will seem strange, but I'm sorry, Islam has no place in Slovakia. I think it is the duty of politicians to talk about these things very clearly and openly. I do not wish there were tens of thousands of Muslims". 
On November 30, 2016, the Slovak Parliament, under the government led by Fico, passed a bill significantly increasing the minimum threshold for a religious movement or organization to achieve state recognition. The required number of verified practicing members was raised from 20,000 to 50,000. This legislation has been widely viewed as an explicit measure to prevent Islam from gaining state-recognized status in Slovakia. Islam is not an official religion in Slovakia and there are no officially recognized mosques.
Fico strongly opposed the EU's Asylum and Migration Pact finalized in 2024, particularly the solidarity mechanism. He stated that Slovakia will not implement the rule that requires member states to either accept a share of asylum seekers or pay a financial contribution of €20,000 per person if they refuse, calling this a "dictate" rather than genuine solidarity and saying that out of "100% of illegal migrants who arrive in Europe, 80% stay there, and only 20% we manage to get back".

LGBT+
Fico's gender policy is highly conservative and centered on restricting the rights and recognition of LGBTQ+ individuals under the banner of upholding traditional values and national identity against "gender ideology".
Fico and his political allies have used derogatory rhetoric when speaking about the transgender community, with Fico himself reportedly stating he did not want people "who will claim to be women and have a 20cm dick between their legs."
In 2023, Fico referred to adoption by same-sex couples as a "perversion", stated that he would never support same-sex marriage. He said that "gender ideology in schools is unacceptable".
This political stance was formally enacted as law by a September 2025 constitutional amendment, passed by his government, which recognizes only male and female as genders, severely limits adoption to married heterosexual couples, and asserts the primacy of Slovak law over EU law on such "cultural-ethical issues".

NATO
Fico's attitude toward NATO is characterized by profound skepticism and a policy trajectory that clashes directly with the alliance's consensus, despite Slovakia's membership.
Fico has openly questioned the value of NATO membership for Slovakia, publicly suggesting that the country would be "very beneficial" as a neutral nation amid the current "nonsensical times of arms buildup". A major point of contention is his sharp criticism of NATO's push for increased defense spending, with Fico calling the proposed financial requirements "absolutely absurd". The requirements refer to the proposal, heavily advocated by U.S. President Donald Trump, to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. He framed the issue as a stark choice, suggesting that failing to meet the financial target could force Slovakia to "leave NATO". Furthermore, Fico has used strong rhetoric to criticize the alliance's broader orientation, accusing Western leaders of being "warmongers".
Fico stated he would not approve Ukraine's accession to NATO while he was prime minister, which is significant since NATO decisions on enlargement require unanimous agreement from all members. Fico said that allowing Ukraine to join the alliance would pose a significant security risk, serving as a "trigger for a World War III". He said he was "very pleased" that Ukraine's NATO membership has been stalled.

Privatizations
Fico's political career has been characterized by a resolute opposition to the privatization of key state assets and public services, a stance that has significantly influenced his policies on the economy and healthcare. Fico has consistently positioned himself against the sale of strategic state enterprises, often labeling the privatizations carried out by previous center-right governments as corrupt and a form of "theft".
One of his very first and most decisive actions upon coming to power in 2006 was the cancellation of the Bratislava Airport sale to the TwoOne consortium, which was led by Vienna Airport and included the Czech-Slovak group Penta Investments. Fico’s government officially scrapped the deal, stating that the airport was a strategic company that the state must retain control of it for economic and security reasons.
This anti-privatization drive also extended into the healthcare system and his pursuit of a single state-run health insurance company. A central policy of his first government was to ban private health insurance companies from distributing profits (dividends) to their shareholders, stating that public funds intended for treatment should not be privatized. This policy led to an international arbitration case, which the Slovak Republic ultimately lost, resulting in the International Court of Arbitration awarding damages of €22 million to Achmea, the Dutch owner of the health insurance company Union. The ban on distributing profits was later ruled unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court. Fico’s subsequent governments pushed for the expropriation or buyout of the remaining private health insurers, in order to establish a single state insurer to "stop the inflow of funds to private provider," a goal he has yet to fully achieve.
In 2008, Fico threatened the foreign owners of energy monopolies such as SPP (the French Gaz de France and the German E.ON) with the nationalization and seizure of their ownership shares if they "make policies that go against state policy, against the interests of this state and its people". This aggressive stance was taken during a heated dispute over domestic retail gas prices, underscoring his willingness to assert direct state influence over key utilities.
Fico's anti-privatization stance extended to the strategic Gabčíkovo Dam, whose lucrative hydroelectric plant operation had been leased to the privatized utility, majority-owned by Italy's Enel. Stating the 2006 lease was illegal and against national interest, Fico's government launched a lengthy legal and political campaign. This culminated in the state successfully taking back full operational control of the power plant in 2015, which Fico presented as reclaiming a critical national asset from foreign private ownership.

Social policy
Fico's domestic social policy is fundamentally built on social populism, prioritizing tangible benefits for key electoral demographics, specifically older and lower-income citizens. A cornerstone of this policy is the "thirteenth pension," an annual payment designed to provide crucial financial support to pensioners, positioning himself as a guardian of the elderly's financial security.
His governments have consistently aimed to reverse austerity measures imposed by center-right cabinets, increasing other social benefits and intervening to limit the rise in costs for essential services like utilities and prescription medications. Furthermore, his administration introduced free rail transport for large demographic groups, including students up to age 26 and pensioners, a measure intended to lower living costs and solidify a perceived social safety net.
Fico has made the continual and significant increase of the national minimum wage, often boasting about its multi-fold rise since his first government and arguing that it is essential to ensure that "it is not possible for someone who works to live under the poverty limit". Fico's government implemented a significant increase in night shift bonuses, as well as bonuses for weekend and public holiday work, to directly improve the wages of lower-income workers.
Fico also advocated for a four-day working week to be introduced, initially as an experiment where business conditions allow for agreement between employers and unions. He stated at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2024 that Slovakia could soon be among the countries adopting this measure. The four-day working week has not been implemented during his time in office.
He has promised a "return to the values of a social state," often criticizing the prior "right-wing reforms" by saying they were "for the rich" and vowing to continue reforms but "not on the backs of the people". This policy boosted the living standards of his base through subsidies and generous state spending. Critics say it is fiscally irresponsible, potentially jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of public finances in favor of short-term political gains.

Wars
Fico's stance on foreign wars has been characterized by a notable shift over his multiple tenures as Slovakia's prime minister. 
During his first government, which began in 2006, Fico fulfilled a campaign promise by withdrawing Slovak troops from the Iraq War in early 2007, describing the US-led invasion as "unbelievably unjust and wrong". Fico said that the security situation there was "catastrophic" and that "to speak about any democracy in Iraq is a fantasy," and that the entry of foreign armies had only caused immense tension. He said the Iraq commitment was a reckless "adventure", contrasting it with the NATO mission in Afghanistan, which he said "conforms to international law" and which he subsequently increased.
His governments maintained Slovakia's participation in the NATO-led War in Afghanistan for many years. Slovak soldiers, including Special Operations Forces, served in Afghanistan in non-combat roles such as training, advisory, and base security throughout Fico’s first three terms (2006–2010, 2012–2016 and 2016–2018).
In 2023, Fico's foreign policy turned toward non-involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian war. Fico said that "some European leaders are tired of 80 years of peace" and want to escalate tensions with Russia. He said that "I will never be a wartime prime minister" and criticized the European Union, stating, "If the EU spent as much energy on peace as it does on supporting the war in Ukraine, the war could have been over long ago". After taking office in 2023, his government fulfilled an election promise by terminating all military aid to Kyiv while continuing to send humanitarian aid. His government has since refused to participate in any EU scheme to finance military aid to Ukraine, stating that the conflict cannot be solved on the battlefield.

Foreign policy
China
Fico has actively pursued closer ties with China, which is Slovakia's largest trading partner outside the European Union. During a November 2024 visit, he and President Xi Jinping agreed to elevate bilateral relations to a Strategic Partnership and signed 13 cooperation documents. Fico's government supports China's "all-azimuth diplomacy" approach, prioritizing economic cooperation in areas like new energy and infrastructure. He has publicly opposed EU tariffs on China-made electric vehicles, seeking Chinese investment like the Gotion battery plant in Slovakia.
On sensitive political issues, Fico's government consistently adheres to the "one China policy" and, regarding Tibet and human rights, the joint statement from his November 2024 visit opposed the "politicization and instrumentalization of human rights issues" and interference in internal affairs. This stance is consistent with Fico's past actions, such as when he criticized a predecessor for meeting the Dalai Lama.
Fico aligns with China's diplomatic efforts regarding the Ukraine conflict, commending Beijing's position as "fair, objective, and constructive," and publicly expressing Slovakia's readiness to join the China-Brazil "Friends for Peace" initiative.
In September 2025, as the only leader of an EU member state take part in the commemorative events marking the 80th anniversary of the Chinese people’s victory in the War of Resistance against Japan and the end of World War II in Beijing.

European Union
Fico's relationship with the European Union has changed over his multiple terms as prime minister.
During his first premiership, he oversaw key integration steps like joining the Schengen Area in 2007 and Eurozone in 2009, demonstrating a commitment to core EU structures. In a speech to the Oxford Union praised Slovakia's entry into the EU as a "success story".
Fico's Second Cabinet opposed EU migrant quotas since 2015, characterizing the European Union's migration policy as "ritual suicide" if it fails to stop the inflow of migrants and secure its external borders. He has opposed mandatory relocation and, in 2024, declared Slovakia's unwillingness to implement the new EU Migration Pact. He said that the quota system is ineffective, a "dictate," and a security risk.
During his third premiership, he led Slovakia's successful six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union in the latter half of 2016. In this role, he hosted the informal Bratislava Summit in September 2016. In August 2017, Fico said: "The fundamentals of my policy are being close to the (EU) core, close to France, to Germany. I am very much interested in regional cooperation within the Visegrád Four but Slovakia's vital interest is the European Union.

Fico’s political position often includes criticism of Brussels, as he states that his government prioritizes "Slovakia First" and must retain autonomy over its foreign policy. He has further warned that the European Union could break up like the Warsaw Pact, expressing concern that the bloc's practices, such as "suppressing the sovereignty of individual Member States," threaten the entire European project. He said, "If someone had asked me in 1988 if I thought the Warsaw Pact would fall apart within a year, I would have thought they were crazy. And a year later, it suddenly no longer existed".
During his fourth term, Fico was a critic of the Von der Leyen Commission, describing its foreign and military policies toward the Russian invasion of Ukraine as "madness". He challenged the Commission's authority by stating that "Neither members of the Commission nor the president of the European Council can permit themselves to make statements, in the name of the European Union, on which the European Union and the European Council have never agreed."
Fico has frequently condemned the bloc's policy toward Russia, stating that existing sanctions are "ideologically and obsessively anti-Russian". He has also accused the EU of reviving an "Iron Curtain" mentality toward Russia, saying Slovakia will not be a part of it and that he will strive for peaceful cooperation.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and a strong critic of Russia, publicly clashed with Fico in 2025. The dispute centered on Fico's choice to attend the Victory Day parade in Moscow to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat, a decision made during Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine. Kallas's had warned EU member states and candidate country leaders not to attend. Fico said Kallas' comment "confirms we need a discussion within the EU about the essence of democracy". Fico said his attendance was a tribute to the Red Army. Kallas said he was on the "wrong side of history".
Fico has criticised the European Union's Green Deal, stating that many of its ambitious climate targets were "unsustainable" and describing it as a "nonsensical dictate" that prioritizes ideology over economic reality. He said that measures like the 2035 ban on combustion engines and the ETS2 mechanism for heating and transport threaten the Slovak economy's vital automotive and heavy industries, making Europe uncompetitive against global rivals like China.

Hungary
The relationship between Slovakia and Hungary during the various governments of Robert Fico has dramatically evolved, shifting from intense diplomatic friction to a close ideological alliance. 
This relationship entered a period of severe strain following Fico's 2006 election victory when he included the fiercely nationalist Slovak National Party and its anti-Hungarian leader, Ján Slota, in his governing coalition. In the wake of the election several incidents occurred which further inflamed nationalist sentiment on both sides, including the alleged beating of a Hungarian woman in South Slovakia. Fico reacted by condemning the extremism but rebuked the Hungarian government by declaring, "The Slovak government doesn't need to be called on to strike against extremism."
The first Fico government was responsible for measures that heightened tensions, including a controversial law on the Beneš decrees in 2007 that declared them "inviolable" and unchangeable.
This legislative focus on national identity and sovereignty continued with subsequent controversial acts: The Fico government intensified ethnic friction with the 2009 amendment to the Slovak State Language Act, which was widely criticized for expanding the mandatory use of Slovak in public life and reintroducing fines of up to €5,000 for non-compliance, particularly affecting businesses and public entities in Hungarian-majority areas. This law was a major point of conflict because it was seen as restricting the rights of the Hungarian minority to use their native language in official communications.
Another significant point of conflict was the issue of dual citizenship, specifically the Slovak government's reaction to Hungary's 2010 law that simplified the process for ethnic Hungarians abroad to acquire Hungarian citizenship. In direct response to this, Fico's government swiftly amended the Slovak Citizenship Act in 2010 to impose sanctions, stipulating that any Slovak citizen who voluntarily acquired a foreign citizenship would automatically lose their Slovak citizenship, a move Fico justified due to the perceived "security threat" of potential mass granting of Hungarian citizenship.
During this phase, Fico also openly criticized Hungarian politics, warning about its potential influence and publicly labeling Viktor Orbán's Fidesz party as an "extreme nationalist party" in 2008. Following the initial crisis, relations entered a more pragmatic phase after Fico returned to power in 2012, focusing on economic and practical cross-border cooperation.
A significant reversal occurred by 2022, marking a warming trend as Fico publicly welcomed Orbán's re-election and praised his nationalistic approach. Similarly, Hungarian foreign minister Péter Szijjártó welcomed Fico's return to office in 2023, commenting: "Robert Fico has the same views on the war, migration and gender issues as us". Since Fico's return to office in 2023, the two countries have forged a strong strategic and ideological partnership, characterized by shared opposition to the European Union's stance on migration and military aid to Ukraine. This close alignment has positioned Slovakia as a key ally for Hungary in Brussels, with Fico publicly stating that the "sovereign positions of Hungary and Slovakia would be suitable for a significant strengthening of cooperation within the Visegrad Four".

Israel
Fico has maintained a long-standing and significant diplomatic relationship with Israel, demonstrated through various official actions and meetings. During his 2007 official visit to Israel, Fico met with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to discuss expanding economic and research cooperation between the two countries. Fico also confirmed Slovakia's readiness to support the imposition of UN sanctions on Iran. 
In July 2017, Fico engaged with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a Visegrad Four summit in Budapest, where their bilateral discussions centered on deepening cooperation in innovation, the automotive sector, and defense technology. 
In October 2023, Fico condemned the Hamas-led attack on Israel but also stated "we cannot tolerate thousands of dead Palestinian civilians, as collateral damage". In December 2023, Fico criticized the European Union's "hypocrisy," claiming that the organization was unwilling to openly discuss the extensive civilian death toll in the Gaza Strip.
Fico, held a telephone conversation with Netanyahu, in June 2025 where he offered diplomatic support and provided insight into Slovakia's policy positions. Specifically, Fico expressed his welcome for the "hard-won ceasefire" that brought an end to the conflict between Iran and Israel. He underscored Slovakia's commitment to diplomatic methods, stating clearly that his nation opposes any proposals within the EU to suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Fico justified this stance by emphasizing the necessity of maintaining open communication channels, commenting that shutting down dialogue is unacceptable, citing the situation with the Russian Federation as a negative example. In concluding his statement, Fico affirmed that mutual communication would continue, characterizing the relationship between Slovakia and Israel as "constructive, rooted in our shared history," and notably mentioning the presence of a large Slovak diaspora living in Israel.

Russia
After coming to power in 2006, Fico declared that Slovakia's relations with Russia would improve after eight years of "neglect". Fico referred to "Slavonic solidarity", which was a central theme of the Slovak National Awakening in the 1850s. 
On 4 April 2008, during a visit by Russian prime minister Viktor Zubkov, Fico said: "In Slovakia, there have been efforts to deliberately ignore Slavonic solidarity." Slovakia modernised Russian MiG fighters in Russia and did not buy new jets from the West. Fico accused Georgia of "provoking Russia" in 2008 when Russia invaded Georgia.

In June 2008, The Slovak Spectator published a piece which summarized his foreign policy in this way: Compensating for his lack of close political allies within the EU, the former Czech Social Democratic Party leader Jiří Paroubek being a notable exception, Fico sought to strengthen relations with several non-EU countries such as Serbia and Russia. This broke with a pro-NATO, Western-focused trend established after the 1998 Slovak election. Under his premiership, the Slovak foreign ministry rejected the March 2014 Crimean status referendum, which incorporated Crimea into Russia; Fico himself remained silent on the issue. Regarding the EU sanctions against Russia for its illegal annexation, Fico denounced them as "senseless" and a "threat to the Slovak economy".
Fico condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022; he also opposed European sanctions against Russia for the invasion, arguing that the sanctions help Russian autarky and only harm the Russian population and European population rather than the regime. Fico invited the Russian diplomat Igor Bratchikov to speak at the celebration of the Slovak National Uprising on 29 August 2022. 
In 2023, Fico said that the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation violated international law but that Ukraine re-taking Crimea would not solve the Russo-Ukrainian War. 
Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Fico met multiple times with the Russian president Vladimir Putin. First time in December 2024 in Moscow, to discuss primarily the transfer of Russian gas to Slovakia. Second time in May 2025, as the only leader of an EU member state attended the Russian Victory Day parade. Once again he met with him in September 2025 in Beijing, as the only leader of an EU member state take part in the commemorative events marking the 80th anniversary of the Chinese people’s victory in the War of Resistance against Japan and the end of World War II.
These visits were seen as controversial, as they undermined EU unity against Russia's war in Ukraine and contradicted Western efforts to isolate Russia.

Ukraine
During his previous premierships before 2023, Fico maintained a pragmatic and generally constructive working relationship with his Ukrainian counterparts. Slovakia consistently supported Ukraine's territorial integrity and its European integration aspirations, especially after the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and the start of the conflict in Donbas. A major bilateral issue was gas supply: Fico's governments played a crucial role by establishing the reverse gas flow to Ukraine, notably following the 2009 and 2014 Russian gas cutoffs, ensuring Kyiv received vital energy supplies from the West through Slovak pipelines. While maintaining ties with Russia, Fico followed EU sanctions against Moscow, but he also often called for their abolition and openly stated they were ineffective. Official visits and bilateral meetings were routine, focusing on cross-border cooperation, trade, and infrastructure projects, underscoring a commitment to neighborly ties.
The premiership since 2023 marks a fundamental and hostile shift in Fico's relationship with Ukraine and its leadership. Following the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Fico adopted a staunchly anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian political narrative, directly challenging Kyiv and the Western alliance. Upon taking office, he immediately halted state military aid to Ukraine, fulfilling a central campaign promise.
In January 2024, Fico stated that "Ukraine is not an independent and sovereign country and is under the influence of the United States". He has also often questioned the effectiveness of sanctions against Russia and tried to block them within the European Union. His rhetoric includes statements that Ukraine must cede territory to Russia to end the war, a position that Kyiv considers unacceptable and has led to direct friction. He has also announced his firm intention to block Ukraine's NATO membership, claiming it would provoke a World War.
On 5 September 2025, Fico met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian city of Uzhhorod, which is situated close to the Slovak border. During the significant discussion, Fico voiced support for Ukraine's accession to the European Union. He also assured President Zelenskyy that Slovakia supports all initiatives aimed at achieving a ceasefire and lasting peace. However, he simultaneously stated that the two nations have "diametrically opposed views" on energy policy. Fico stressed that Slovakia must pursue energy policies aligned with its sovereign national interests and called for respect for all countries in the energy network, referencing the negative impact of Ukrainian strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline. Finally, he defended his recent engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin by stating that "one day the war will end," and normalisation of relations with Russia will become necessary.

United States
In November 2013, Fico traveled to Washington, D.C., where he was hosted by U.S. President Barack Obama. The two leaders held talks centered on the long-standing U.S.-Slovak partnership. During the visit, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Fico said the relationship is "firmly rooted in shared democratic values and principles." The meetings served not only to reinforce existing ties but also to underscore mutual commitment to democratic governance and security cooperation. Concluding the highly successful engagement, Prime Minister Fico unequivocally reaffirmed the enduring strategic partnership between Slovakia and the United States. 
In February 2025, Fico was a confirmed speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held in National Harbor, Maryland. During his address, Fico endorsed U.S. President Donald Trump. He commended President Trump's "energy in negotiations on Ukraine," stating Trump had taken a constructive approach to seeking an end to the conflict. Fico stated that President Trump was providing a "great service to Europe by bringing the truth" to the continent's current political climate. Fico also said in his speech that Russia had "serious security reasons for the war".
Fico visited the gravesite of U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Michael Strank in Arlington National Cemetery on February 21, 2025 to honour a Slovak native who fought and died as an American hero in World War II. Strank was one of the six Iwo Jima flag raisers in the iconic Iwo Jima photograph, and was specifically honored because he was born in the village of Jarabina in present-day Slovakia before immigrating to the U.S. as a child. Fico laid flowers at the gravesite of the Slovak-born American hero, acknowledging the transatlantic military and historical connection.

Visegrád Group
Fico consistently places the Visegrád Group (V4), comprising Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, at the forefront of his foreign policy priorities, calling it the essential regional format for asserting Central European interests. He champions the V4 as a necessary alliance to achieve a "sovereign Slovak foreign policy" that protects national autonomy against the perceived overreach of Brussels.
Fico sees the V4 cooperation as "destined for success" and crucial for looking for regional solutions where the European Union "unfortunately does not provide such solutions today". He is particularly keen on increasing V4 collaboration on shared sovereign interests like energy security. Furthermore, he seeks strong V4 coordination on illegal migration, where the group maintains a collective and firm opposition to mandatory migrant relocation quotas while advocating for increased EU funding for external border protection.
A key issue successfully elevated to the V4 agenda by Fico administration is the "dual quality of food," where products under the same brand are of different quality in Western versus Central European markets. Fico stated that V4 citizens were being "humiliated" by multinational corporations that offered them products with inferior ingredients, and the V4's collective pressure ultimately led to EU legislation prohibiting this misleading marketing.

Relationship with the media
During his press conferences, Robert Fico often verbally attacks, belittles, and taunts the present journalists, often accusing them of bias and attacking his government. On several occasions he has openly and on record used profanities against specific journalists, such as "idiots", "pricks", "prostitutes", "snakes", and "hyenas". He has also been recorded ridiculing journalists' physical appearance.

Verbal attacks
In 2009, Fico repeatedly described the Slovak press as a "new opposition force" that was biased and was harming national and state interests. Fico also accused the press of failing to "stand behind the common people."
In July 2012, Fico declared "Eternal Peace" between him and the Slovak press. He also stated his desire to change his attitude towards the media, saying "I think it is enough" and that he does not plan any further lawsuits against media outlets except in extraordinary situations. Fico further said: "You have to spend an incredible amount of energy on it [lawsuits], it means several years of conflict, one conflict takes usually five or six years [to resolve]." He added that lawsuits involve "legal fees, paying a lawyer, everything around that".
In November 2016, Fico termed journalists questioning him about allegations of public procurement rules during Slovakia's EU presidency as "dirty, anti-Slovak prostitutes". He also stated the accusations were a targeted attack to smear the country's presidency of the EU.
In November 2021, Fico described journalists as "Soros' corrupt gang of swines for whom water is already boiling." He says that the media is "obsessed" with him and his party; they want to "destroy" it and are "waging a jihad against it." 
In 2022, Fico repeatedly stated that journalists were an "organized criminal group with the aim of breaking Slovak statehood" and called on the Slovak Police Force to investigate them.

Press Freedom Predator
In October 2025, Fico was included on the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) 2025 list of Press Freedom Predators under the "Social" category. The RSF placed Slovakia 38th out of 180 countries in its 2025 press freedom rankings. According to RSF, "social" predators "smear media and promote mistrust of journalists". In its assessment, the RSF cited various terms that Fico had used to describe journalists. It also mentioned political control of public broadcasting. The full list of those named as 2025 Press Freedom Predators in the "social" category included Elon Musk, Honest reporting, Margarita Simonyan, OpIndia and Javier Milei.

Personal life
Relationships
Fico has two siblings, younger sister Lucia and older brother Ladislav. 
Fico is married to Svetlana Ficová (née Svobodová), a lawyer and associate professor from Žilina. They were classmates while they both studied law at the Comenius University in Bratislava, and they married in 1988. They have one son together, Michal (b. 1994), who studied at the University of Economics in Bratislava. Despite his marriage, Fico hasn't lived with his wife since 2019, and doesn't attend any official events with her. At least since 2020, Fico has practiced an open relationship with Katarína Szalayová; they have been seen together in public on many occasions. 
Fico became a grandfather for the first time in 2022, as his son Michal Fico and his wife welcomed a baby girl Pavlína.

Wealth
Fico's property situation has drawn significant public and media scrutiny over the years. For a long period, he was known for renting luxury properties rather than owning them.
Notably, he lived in a large apartment within the Bonaparte complex, located in Bratislava's Old Town, which was a 377-square-meter luxurious residence. He rented this apartment starting in 2012 from controversial businessman Ladislav Bašternák, a figure later convicted of tax fraud. This arrangement, which cost €2,850 monthly, became a major source of criticism and was cited in political controversies.
After leaving the Bonaparte complex in 2019, he stayed in various temporary residences. In January 2021, Fico moved into a luxury apartment in the Sokolská Residence, which he rented from his party colleague Dušan Muňko in a highly desirable and lucrative part of Bratislava. This residence is located in the Old Town district, specifically in the prestigious diplomatic quarter under the Slavín memorial, which is known for its high-end residential character. In 2023, Fico purchased a 135-square-meter apartment in the residence for €509,000, securing it at a price significantly below the expert-estimated market value of €750,000 to €1 million.
His income largely stems from his political office. As the prime minister of Slovakia, his salary is substantial. Reports from 2025 indicate his annual salary is approximately €144,000 (or roughly 8 times the national average). Furthermore, in June 2024, a law was passed that grants a lifetime salary to former prime ministers who have served more than two full electoral cycles. As the longest-serving prime minister, Fico is currently the only politician who qualifies for this exceptional retirement benefit.

Health
In July 2009, Fico faced genuine cervical spine problems (neck and back pain) severe enough to disrupt his official schedule. This inspired a cartoon by Martin Šútovec (Shooty) in the daily Sme, which controversially depicted Fico's X-ray showing "no spine" and his pain as merely "phantom". Fico strongly objected, filing a lawsuit for €33,000, arguing the cartoon made fun of his serious health condition. The court ruled against Fico in 2010, upholding the cartoon as protected political satire and exaggeration. After losing at the lower courts and having the case returned by the Supreme Court on a technicality, Fico ultimately withdrew the lawsuit in March 2013, ending the protracted legal battle.
In February 2014, Fico seriously injured his left foot during a football match in Košice, which was part of his campaign before the presidential election. His injury required emergency surgery at the Kramáre Hospital in Bratislava. In the hospital, he was diagnosed with a torn Achilles tendon.
Fico experienced a recurrence of his serious spinal health issues in April 2014, five years after his first reported incident. These health problems, involving his neck and back, were significant enough to force him to cancel a portion of his official public schedule.
In April 2016, Fico underwent coronary triple bypass surgery in the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases in Bratislava.
In December 2019, Fico left the annual Direction – Social Democracy party congress to seek medical treatment due to high blood pressure.
In Summer 2021, while on vacation in Greece, Fico passed out during breakfast. A German cardiologist from the next table helped him, thinking he had a heart attack. He was taken to the hospital, where doctors found out that it was COVID-19, which, combined with fever and low blood pressure, had caused him to pass out. Over the next few days in Crete, Fico stayed in quarantine.
On 15 May 2024, Fico was shot several times in an assassination attempt and was subsequently hospitalized at the F.D. Roosevelt Hospital in Banská Bystrica. Fico was reportedly in a "life-threatening" condition after the attack, having suffered wounds to his stomach, arms, and legs, but was stabilized following emergency surgery.
Fico's recovery from the assassination attempt continued throughout late 2024 and into 2025, marked by ongoing health complications. He frequently canceled or cut short public engagements, often attributing this to vague health issues, though he hinted that the problems were linked to digestion as a result of the shooting. These persistent issues led to more significant disruptions, such as the cancellation of a summit trip in October 2025, which he officially excused due to "worsened health problems still related to last year's attack".

Religion
Fico has rarely discussed his religious life in public. In his application to join the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1984, Fico stated that he was "strictly atheistic", as was required to be accepted. According to the testimonial from college added to the application, he held a "scientific Marxist-Leninist worldview" and "no problems concerning religion."
In a promotional video during presidential election campaign in 2014, Fico said he grew up in a Catholic family and that he considers himself a Catholic. He discussed his baptism, Holy Communion, Confirmation and how the Catholic faith had impacted his childhood. He stated: "Perhaps if I did my profile in relation to the Catholic Church, I would end up better off than any MP of the KDH." He also described growing up with his grandfather, a man who "very strictly respected the rules of standard Christian life", stating that it profoundly impacted him. Patrik Dubovský, a historian and former researcher of the National Memory Institute, considers it to be an attempt to manipulate public opinion because "confirmation was in direct conflict with Communist Party membership, whose political programme was based on atheism." During the Communist period, religiously active people were severely persecuted, especially after the repression of Charter 77.
During a televised debate, Fico refused to answer a television presenter's question about whether he is a Christian or an atheist, and said that he considered it a private matter. Regarding the sacraments, Fico said that he was baptised as an infant and the Holy Communion with Confirmation followed afterwards, as he said it was with every child who grew up in his home village.
In April 2025, Fico released a statement on social media following the death of Pope Francis, where he called himself "a man of deep faith".

Language
Apart from his native Slovak language, Fico is fluent in English and Russian.

Alleged extramarital affairs
In August 2010, Fico was photographed at night in downtown Bratislava together with a woman, who was later revealed to be 25-year-old Jana Halászová, a secretary at the Direction – Social Democracy party headquarters. It was later revealed that Halászová had been given extensive privileges, including her own parking space in the Parliament car park, without being a member. In addition, both her sister and step-mother had recently been given jobs within various ministries. In August 2013, Fico was photographed while embracing and kissing his now-secretary Halászová, after taking her for a private dinner at a chateau in Čereňany, 160 kilometres from Bratislava. The photos created another round of speculation about the true nature of their relationship, as well as whether or not he had used public funds to pay for the dinner.
