This is a list of the longest team winning streaks in Major League Baseball history. Streaks started at the end of one season are carried over into the following season. The lists below include streaks that consist entirely of regular season games, streaks from the predecessor National Association (1871–1875), streaks of playoff games, and streaks of World Series games.
The National League’s 1916 New York Giants hold the record of winning 26 consecutive games. The longest American League winning streak is 22, by the 2017 Cleveland Indians.
The longest winning streak consisting only of playoff games stands at 12 consecutive wins, by the 1927, 1928 and 1932 New York Yankees (who swept the World Series all three seasons) and tied by the 1998–99 Yankees. 
According to Major League Baseball's policy on winning streaks, tie games do not end a team's winning streak. The list below includes streaks with ties.
