The American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift has released 12 original studio albums, 4 re-recorded albums, 5 extended plays (EPs), and 4 live albums. In the United States, as of May 2025, she had sold 116.7 million album-equivalent units, coming from 54 million pure sales and 70.7 billion streams; the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as of September 2025 certified 105 million album units, making her the highest-certified female album artist. On the Billboard 200 chart, she has accumulated 15 albums and 91 total weeks at number one, more than any other solo act.
Swift released six albums with Big Machine Records. Her debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), spent more weeks on the Billboard 200 than any other album in the 2000s decade, and her second, Fearless (2008), was the only album from the 2000s decade to spend one year in the top 10 of the Billboard 200. Fearless was Swift's first album to top the charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Her next studio albums—Speak Now (2010), Red (2012), 1989 (2014), and Reputation (2017)—all reached number one on the Billboard 200, and each of them sold over one million US first-week copies. All four albums reached number one in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand; and the latter three all reached number one in the United Kingdom.
Under a recording contract with Republic Records signed in 2018, Swift has released six original studio albums—Lover (2019), Folklore (2020), Evermore (2020), Midnights (2022), The Tortured Poets Department (2024), and The Life of a Showgirl (2025)—all of them peaked atop the Billboard 200. Lover was Swift's first to reach number one in Spain and Sweden. Midnights, The Tortured Poets Department, and The Life of a Showgirl each sold one million first-week copies in the United States, and they reached number one in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Spain, Norway, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, The Tortured Poets Department was Swift's first album to open with two million units first-week, and The Life of a Showgirl opened with four million units, becoming the fastest-selling album in modern American history.
Swift's departure from Big Machine resulted in a dispute over the ownership of her first six studio albums in 2019, which resulted in her re-recording four albums—Fearless (Taylor's Version) (2021), Red (Taylor's Version) (2021), Speak Now (Taylor's Version) (2023), and 1989 (Taylor's Version) (2023)—all of which reached number one in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Fearless (Taylor's Version) was the first re-recorded album to top the Billboard 200, and 1989 (Taylor's Version) sold over a million US first-week copies. Swift holds the record for the most annual best-selling albums in the United States—eight times: Fearless in 2009, 1989 in 2014, Reputation in 2017, Lover in 2019, Folklore in 2020, Midnights in 2022, 1989 (Taylor's Version) in 2023, and The Tortured Poets Department in 2024.
