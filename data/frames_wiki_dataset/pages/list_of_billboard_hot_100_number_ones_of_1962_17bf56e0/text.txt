These are the Billboard Hot 100 number one hits of 1962.
That year, 14 acts achieved their first number one songs, namely Joey Dee and the Starliters, Gene Chandler, Bruce Channel, Shelley Fabares, Mr. Acker Bilk, David Rose, Bobby Vinton, Neil Sedaka, Little Eva, Tommy Roe, The Four Seasons, Bobby "Boris" Pickett, The Crystals, and The Tornados. The Four Seasons were the only act to have more than one song hit number one that year.
NOTE: Billboard changed its issue dates from a Monday back to a Saturday schedule on January 6, thus fixing the previous one-week inconsistency. The issue dates were originally changed from a Saturday to a Monday schedule on April 29, 1957.
