David Lynch (January 20, 1946 – January 15, 2025) was an American filmmaker, visual artist, musician and actor. Known for his surrealist films, he developed his own  cinematic style which has been dubbed "Lynchian" and is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous sound design. The surreal and, in many cases, violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they "disturb, offend or mystify" their audiences.

Lynch's oeuvre includes short and feature-length films, music videos, documentaries and television episodes, while his involvement in these ranged from direction, production, and screenwriting to acting and sound design. Lynch's first project was the 1967 short Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times), an animated film which blended elements of sculpture and painting into its animation.
His first feature-length project, 1977's Eraserhead, became a cult film and launched his commercial career. It also marked his first collaboration with Jack Nance, who would appear in many more of Lynch's productions until the death of the actor in 1996. Lynch's other feature films include the commercial flop Dune, and the critically successful The Elephant Man (1980), Blue Velvet (1986), The Straight Story (1999) and Mulholland Drive (2001), all of which went on to earn Academy Award nominations.
Lynch also branched out into television, and later, internet-based series. His first foray into television was Twin Peaks, a joint venture with Mark Frost which became a cult success, leading to Lynch and Frost working together on a number of other projects, including On the Air and American Chronicles.
In 2002, Lynch began producing two series of short films released through his official website: the Flash-animated DumbLand and Rabbits. Having begun acting in his 1972 short The Amputee, Lynch went on to appear on screen in Twin Peaks, Zelly and Me, and Dune. From 2010 to 2013, Lynch appeared in a recurring voice role in the animated series The Cleveland Show. He was a supporting actor in the 2017 John Carroll Lynch film Lucky.
