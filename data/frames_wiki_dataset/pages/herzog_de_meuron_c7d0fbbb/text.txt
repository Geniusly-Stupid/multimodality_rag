History and international recognition
Herzog & de Meuron Basel Ltd. was founded in 1978 in Basel, Switzerland, by Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, graduates of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in 1977. The firm initially gained recognition for minimalist designs and innovative use of materials, such as the Blue House in Oberwil (1980) and the Ricola Storage Building in Laufen (1987). Their international reputation grew in the 1990s with projects like the Goetz Collection in Munich (1992), which featured glass cladding to diffuse natural light, and the Dominus Winery in Napa Valley (1997), notable for its gabion walls of local stones that integrate the structure with its surroundings.
The transformation of London's Bankside Power Station into the Tate Modern (2000) marked a turning point, blending industrial history with contemporary design. The New York Times praised it as "an example of how architecture can breathe new life into old structures." In 2001, Herzog & de Meuron received the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize, commended for their refined and innovative designs.
High-profile projects in the 2000s included the Beijing National Stadium (2008), known as the "Bird's Nest," created in collaboration with artist Ai Weiwei for the Summer Olympics. Other notable works included the REHAB Basel Clinic (2002), emphasizing light and openness for therapeutic recovery, and the Allianz Arena in Munich (2005), known for its dynamic ETFE façade. The Prada Aoyama store in Tokyo (2003) showcased experimental glass architecture.
In the 2010s, Herzog & de Meuron continued delivering landmark projects like the Vitra-Haus in Weil am Rhein (2010) and the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg (2017), blending a wave-like glass structure with a historic brick warehouse. In New York, 56 Leonard Street (2017) featured a "Jenga-like" design, while the Powerhouse Arts building in Brooklyn (2023) highlighted their expertise in adaptive reuse.
In the 2020s, Herzog & de Meuron's work reflected a continued focus on innovation, sustainability, and cultural context. The M+ Museum in Hong Kong (2021) integrated LED lighting within a minimalist façade, and the Roche pRED Innovation Center in Basel (2023) showcased modular, sustainable design principles for interdisciplinary collaboration. Their healthcare projects include the Kinderspital in Zurich (2024), prioritizing natural materials, light, and healing environments, and ongoing facilities such as Hillerød Hospital in Denmark and UCSF Health Helen Diller Hospital in San Francisco.
Herzog & de Meuron have been recognized globally, receiving the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 2015 for their "profound contributions to architecture." Critic Jonathan Glancey summarized their impact: "Their work combines the physical and poetic, the robust and refined."
