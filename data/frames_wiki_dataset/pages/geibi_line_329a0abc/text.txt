The Geibi Line (芸備線, Geibi-sen) is a railway line operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in the mountainous area of the Chūgoku region in Japan. It begins at Bitchū-Kōjiro Station on the west side of Niimi, Okayama Prefecture, connecting through Miyoshi Station in Miyoshi, Hiroshima Prefecture, and terminating at Hiroshima Station in Hiroshima. In addition to the Chūgoku Expressway, the Geibi Line is considered the main commuter and local rail line covering the route between northern Hiroshima Prefecture and the city of Hiroshima. The name of the line refers to the ancient provinces of Aki (安芸) (in Hiroshima Prefecture) and Bitchū (備中) (in Okayama Prefecture), which the line connects.
Since 2007, the ICOCA card can be used in all stations between Hiroshima Station and Karuga Station (stations in the Hiroshima City Network).
The majority of the line was out of service after a bridge was destroyed in the 2018 Japan floods. The entire line reopened in October 2019.
The line is one of the least used and least profitable in the JR West network, with average daily ridership of just 13 people (slightly more than two per train) on its least trafficked segment. The segment between Bitchu-Kojiro and Bingo-Yawata runs at an annual loss of JPY 700 million, while the segment between Tojo and Bingo-Shobara is both circuitous and speed-restricted, making it less attractive than bus service. However, local authorities along the route have refused to discuss alternative transportation options with JR West.

Station list
Listed in order from Bitchū-Kōjiro Station to Hiroshima Station, though the chart shows through Niimi Station for convenience as all Geibi Line trains originate and terminate at Niimi.

A ● indicates a station at which a Rapid train stops, and ｜ indicates a station at which a Rapid train does not stop. In addition, Rapid trains are only operated from Niimi to Bingo-Ochiai in one direction, and thus the stations it skips are marked ↓. Stations marked with ▼ are where Rapid Shōbara Liner trains (operating from Hiroshima to Bingo-Ochiai) skip and Rapid trains from Bingo-Ochiai to Hiroshima stop. Local trains stop at all stations.
The section of the Geibi Line between Karuga and Hiroshima forms part of the Hiroshima City Network.
From 19 July 2025 to 24 November 2025, JR West has announced plans to operate rapid trains from Hiroshima Station to Bingo-Ochiai Station on weekend and holidays. The Hiroshima-bound train operates as a regular rapid train, while the Bingo-Ochiai-bound train operates as Rapid Shōbara Liner.
