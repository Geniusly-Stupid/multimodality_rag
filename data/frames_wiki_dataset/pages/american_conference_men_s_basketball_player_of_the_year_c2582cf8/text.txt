The American Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year is an award given to the American Conference's most outstanding player. The conference formed in 2013–14 after many schools departed from the original Big East Conference to form their own conference. The conference was called the American Athletic Conference from its inception up until July 21, 2025, at which time it was formally rebranded. Shabazz Napier of UConn was the first-ever winner.
