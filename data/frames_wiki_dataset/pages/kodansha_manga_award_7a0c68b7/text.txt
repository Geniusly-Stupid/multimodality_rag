The Kodansha Manga Award (講談社漫画賞, Kōdansha Manga Shō) is one of Japan's major manga awards. The event is sponsored by publisher Kodansha. It has been awarded annually for serialized manga in its third iteration since 1977.

Categories
The award was originally called the Kodansha Children's Manga Award (講談社児童まんが賞, Kōdansha Jidō Manga Shō) until 1968. In 1970, it was named Kodansha Cultural Award: Children's manga category (講談社出版文化賞   児童まんが部門, Kōdansha Shuppan Bunka Shō: Jidō Manga Bumon). The second version lasted until 1976. The company decided to create multiple categories thereafter.
The award once was given out in four categories: shōnen, shōjo, children, and general. The award was formalized into the present ceremony with initially offering categories only for shōnen and shōjo in 1977. The first award for the general category was in 1982, and the first children's category award was in 2003. The children's category was merged into the shōnen and shōjo categories starting in 2015.
Each winning work will be honored with a bronze statuette, a certificate, and a prize of 1 million yen (about US$7,500).
