Avatar is an American epic science fiction media franchise created by James Cameron, which began with the eponymous 2009 film. Produced by Lightstorm Entertainment and distributed by 20th Century Studios, it consists of associated merchandise, video games, and theme park attractions. Avatar is set in the mid-22nd century on Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system. The films' central conflict is between the indigenous Na'vi led by Jake Sully and Neytiri, and humans led by Colonel Miles Quaritch from the Resources Development Administration (RDA), a megacorp which has arrived on Pandora to colonize and pillage it for its natural resources. The title of the series refers to the genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain that humans pilot to interact with on Pandora.
The first installment, Avatar, was released on December 18, 2009, and is the highest grossing motion picture of all time when ticket price inflation is not considered. The second installment, The Way of Water, was released on December 16, 2022. The planned sequel series was announced by 20th Century Fox on December 11, 2009, one week before Avatar was released to theaters. 20th Century Fox confirmed the series on January 15, 2010. The Avatar franchise is one of the most expensive franchises undertaken, with the combined budget of the first film and its four sequels estimated at $1 billion. The franchise has grossed more than $5.2 billion worldwide; it is the 15th-highest-grossing film series of all time.
Like the original film, the four sequels have "fully encapsulated" stand-alone plots that "come to their own conclusions". The four films have an overarching meta-narrative that connects them to create a large interconnected saga. Cameron described the sequels as "a natural extension of all the themes, and the characters, and the spiritual undercurrents" of the first film.
According to Cameron, Avatar franchise co-producer Jon Landau was "the heart of the Avatar family" and "the center of gravity of our bubble universe."

On Pandora, human colonists and the sentient humanoid indigenous inhabitants of Pandora, the Na'vi, engage in a war over the planet's resources (such as unobtanium) and the latter's continued existence. The film's title refers to the remotely controlled, genetically engineered human-Na'vi bodies used by the film's human characters to interact with the natives. The protagonist, Jake Sully, is a paraplegic young man who travels to Pandora from Earth. Assisting the corporate monolith known as the Resources Development Administration (RDA), he is given an avatar which he uses to interact with the story's heroine, Neytiri, as well as her clan known as the Omatikaya.

Cultural impact
Psychological impact
A phenomenon known as "post-Avatar depression syndrome" (PADS) or "Avatar blues" has been reported among some viewers of the films, characterized by feelings of sadness, disconnection from reality, and longing for the fictional world of Pandora. It is not a recognized medical condition. Symptoms reportedly include depression, meaninglessness, and dissatisfaction with the real world, alongside concerns about Earth's future and issues like climate change. One report mentioned suicidal ideation linked to a desire to reincarnate on Pandora.
The condition is attributed to a yearning for Pandora's utopian society and its harmony with nature, contrasting with Earth's perceived flaws. Affected viewers reportedly express wishes to inhabit Pandora or escape via virtual reality. Estimates from fan forums suggest 10–20% of participants reported similar feelings.

Consideration of indigenous people
Some indigenous groups, including Native Americans, have called for a boycott of the franchise over "tone-deaf" handling of indigenous cultures and cultural appropriation. Both Avatar films have drawn criticism for casting several white and other non-indigenous actors in the roles of the alien native people. Cameron said he tried to move away from a white savior narrative. The film series was criticized for "romanticization of colonization" and putting forward a monolithic portrayal of Indigenous people.
Cameron faced criticism for comments made after the release of the first film. In 2010, Cameron and Avatar actors supported the Xingu peoples in opposing the construction of the Belo Monte Dam.
In 2012, Cameron said Avatar is a fictional retelling of the history of North and South America in the early Colonial period, "with all its conflict and bloodshed between the military aggressors from Europe and the indigenous peoples".

Fandom and online culture
The franchise has inspired a dedicated global fanbase, with communities forming on platforms such as Reddit, Discord, and YouTube. Online discussions often revolve around environmental themes, character arcs, and sequel speculations, contributing to the series' sustained cultural relevance despite periods of dormancy between releases. Large online fan communities including, an Avatar Subreddit, Discord server, Na'vi language forums and classes, and fan based YouTube channels  focused on the franchise, such as Avatar Guys, provide news, and analysis, to fans. This digital engagement has also amplified real-world activism, with fans organizing campaigns tied to the films' ecological messages.

Avatar in Concert
In 2025, the franchise's cultural footprint expanded through live events like "Avatar Live in Concert", which began touring Europe in April, featuring orchestral performances of the films' scores synchronized with film footage. The tour, produced by Avex Classics International, highlighted the series' musical legacy and drew fans to venues such as the Zénith de Paris and Royal Albert Hall. These concerts, alongside the release of the Fire and Ash trailer in August 2025, reignited debates on the franchise's enduring cultural impact.
