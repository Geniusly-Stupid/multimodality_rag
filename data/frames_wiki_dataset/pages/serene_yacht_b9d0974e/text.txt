Serene is one of the world's largest private superyachts.
Built by Italian shipyard Fincantieri with interior design by Reymond Langton Design, Serene was delivered to her owner in August 2011. At delivery, she was one of the 10 largest yachts in the world with an overall length of 133.9 m (439 ft 4 in) and a beam of 18.5 m (60 ft 8 in).

Ownership
The ship was built for Russian vodka tycoon Yuri Shefler for $330m. In the summer of 2014, Bill Gates leased the yacht for US$5 million per week.
In 2014, while vacationing in the south of France, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia bought the vessel from Yuri Shefler for approximately €500 million.

Incident at sea
In August 2017, Serene ran aground on a shallow rock reef in the Red Sea, 37 km (20 nautical miles) off the coast of Sharm El Sheikh. She sustained significant damage to her hull at the bow. The cause was reported to be a combination of navigational error and propulsion failure.

Trivia
The Leonardo da Vinci  painting Salvator Mundi was reported to be on board the yacht from some time in 2019 to late 2020.
