Alfie  Hewett (born 6 December 1997) is a British professional wheelchair tennis player. He is the current world No. 2 in singles and world No. 1 in doubles.
Hewett has won a total of 33 major titles: ten in singles and 23 in doubles, partnering Gordon Reid for all of the latter. The pair completed the Grand Slam in 2021 (the first to do so since Stéphane Houdet first achieved the feat in 2014 with multiple partners), and won Paralympic gold in men's doubles at the 2024 Summer Paralympics, having been silver medalists in the two previous Games. Hewett is also a two-time Paralympic silver medalist in singles (in 2016 and 2024). He won the Wheelchair Tennis Masters in both singles and doubles in 2017, 2021, and 2023.
Hewett was born with a congenital heart defect that required surgery at six months, and suffered from Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease, a condition that inhibits blood flow from the pelvis to the hip joint. His ability to walk was severely impaired and from the age of six he has been a wheelchair user. Though able to walk, Hewett is not fully mobile in the conventional sense and cannot do able-bodied sports.

In 2020 Hewett won the French Open singles title in three sets against Joachim Gérard and partnered Reid to win all three available Grand Slam doubles titles at the Australian Open, US Open and French Open, with the Wimbledon Championships cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
After winning a silver medal in the men's doubles with Reid at the 2020 Summer Paralympics and losing the bronze medal singles match to Reid, world number 2 Hewett spoke about his Paralympic future being "out of his hands", due to a review into whether his disability is severe enough to qualify him to play in a wheelchair under the 2019 revision of International Tennis Federation rules. Hewett was allowed to continue his tennis career after an alteration to the new ITF rules in November 2021.
Hewett was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to tennis.
