Oscar speeches
Longest speech
Adrien Brody spoke for 5 minutes and 40 seconds while accepting Best Actor for The Brutalist at the 97th Academy Awards in 2025. Prior to that, the longest Oscar speech was given by Greer Garson, who spoke for 5 minutes and 30 seconds at the 15th Academy Awards after she was named Best Actress for 1942 for Mrs. Miniver. It was shortly after this incident that the academy set forty-five seconds as the allotted time for an acceptance speech and began to cut the winners off after this time limit. When presenting the Best Actor award at the 24th Academy Awards, Garson quipped, "I think I have ten minutes left over from a highly emotional speech I made a few years ago. I'd be glad to give it to them."
Shortest speech
The shortest Oscar speech was that given by Patty Duke at the 35th Academy Awards after she was named Best Supporting Actress for 1962 for The Miracle Worker. Duke, age 16, was the youngest person at that time to receive an Academy Award in a competitive category. Her acceptance speech was two words – "Thank you" – after which she walked off the stage. When Fred Zinnemann accepted the Best Picture Oscar for A Man For All Seasons, he simply nodded and smiled. However, minutes earlier he had won Best Director and made a speech then, and felt he had nothing to add.
