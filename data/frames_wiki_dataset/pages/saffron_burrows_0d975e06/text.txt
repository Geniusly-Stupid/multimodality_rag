Early life
A Londoner, Saffron Burrows was born in St Pancras in central London and grew up in Stoke Newington. Her mother is a trade unionist and primary school teacher in Hackney and her father is an architect and teacher. Her parents and stepfather were Socialist Workers Party members, and Burrows was politically active from a young age.
Burrows attended William Tyndale Primary School in Islington and then Stoke Newington School in Stoke Newington. When asked for her preference of a school in Hackney or Hampstead, she said she wanted to be in a multicultural and inclusive environment. She enrolled in acting classes at the Anna Scher Theatre in Islington when she was 11.
Burrows had a successful modelling career after she was discovered at age 15 in Covent Garden by fashion photographer Beth Boldt. For five years she divided her time between London and Paris, where she learned French. She found the modelling world's "obsession with the ideal of the body" troubling.

Career
Acting
Burrows made her film debut in 1993 with a small role in Jim Sheridan's In the Name of the Father. Her first significant acting roles came in 1995, as an ambitious young Irishwoman in Circle of Friends, and in Ngozi Onwurah's Welcome II The Terrordome. In 1996 she starred in the BBC production of Dennis Potter's Karaoke and in Hotel de Love; the next year she was seen in Lovelife, Nevada, The Matchmaker and Mike Figgis's One Night Stand. In 1999 she appeared in Figgis's experimental film The Loss of Sexual Innocence, in which she played twins – one raised in England, the other in Italy. In 1999, she appeared in the thriller Deep Blue Sea, and had the title role in Figgis's film adaptation Miss Julie, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. She starred for Figgis again alongside Stellan Skarsgård in Timecode (2000), a split-screen digital experimental film shot in a single take with no edits. She followed it with Gangster No. 1, starring Malcolm McDowell, Paul Bettany and David Thewlis. She next co-starred with Kate Winslet and Dougray Scott in Michael Apted's 1940s drama Enigma and starred in Tempted, an improvised thriller set in New Orleans, with Burt Reynolds and Peter Facinelli.

The play centered on the love triangle of Janey, her husband William Morris (the writer and proponent of the Arts and Crafts movement), and the Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti. London theatre critic Nicholas De Jongh said of her performance: "Burrows takes to the stage like a swan to water ... She deserves no end of watching." On 30 October 2005, she appeared on stage at the Old Vic theatre in London in a rehearsed reading of the 24-hour play Night Sky, alongside Christopher Eccleston.
