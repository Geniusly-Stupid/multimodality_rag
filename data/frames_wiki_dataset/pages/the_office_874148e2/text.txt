The Office is the title of several mockumentary sitcoms based on a British series originally created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant as The Office in 2001. The original series also starred Gervais as manager and primary character David Brent. The two series were broadcast on BBC Two in 2001 and 2002, totalling 12 episodes, with two special episodes concluding the series in 2003. A follow up movie (David Brent: Life on the Road) starring Gervais and featuring his David Brent character was released in 2016.
Versions of the original were subsequently made in Germany, the United States, and many other countries. The longest-running version of the series, the American adaptation, ran for nine seasons on the NBC Television Network from 2005 to 2013, with a total of 201 episodes. According to Nielsen Ratings as of April 2019, the American version of The Office was the No. 1 streamed show on Netflix in the United States. A follow-up to the American version was announced in 2024 for release on Peacock, and Amazon Prime Video also debuted an Australian version of The Office, featuring the franchise's first female lead character, that same year.
