How I Met Your Mother is an American sitcom which ran for nine seasons on CBS. It was created by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas. Set in New York City, the series follows the social and romantic lives of Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) and his four best friends, Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), and Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), as Ted seeks out his future wife. The titular mother is unseen until the season 8 finale, "Something New", where she is portrayed by Cristin Milioti. Milioti was promoted to series regular for the ninth season.
