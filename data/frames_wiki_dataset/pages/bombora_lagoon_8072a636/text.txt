BomBora is a family steel roller coaster currently operating at Lagoon in Farmington, Utah. It is located just outside Lagoon-A-Beach, Lagoon's water park. The name of the coaster comes from an indigenous Australian term for "a submerged reef" or "a turbulent area of sea over such a reef."

History
Construction started in 2010, after lockers for Lagoon-A-Beach were demolished. The roller coaster opened in 2011.

Ride experience
The ride starts with a left turn out of the station and into the lift hill. At the top of the lift hill, riders fall down the highest drop in the ride and enter a series of drops and twists, while surf rock music plays, before reaching the final brake run and returning to the station.
