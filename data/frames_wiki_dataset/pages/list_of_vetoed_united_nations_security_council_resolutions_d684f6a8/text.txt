This is a list of United Nations Security Council Resolutions that have been vetoed by one of the five permanent members of the Security Council since 16 February 1946.

Resolutions
Republic of China
The lone veto ever cast by the Republic of China, blocking the General Assembly membership of Mongolia, was not its own resolution and does not appear in the above table. Instead, the membership applications of 18 countries were being discussed, and the Soviet Union initially demanded 18 different resolutions in the order they applied (which would place Albania and Mongolia first). Other Security Council members objected, and the President of the Security Council (New Zealand) offered a compromise where all 18 applicants would be in one resolution, but each applicant would be voted on separately as though it were an amendment, followed by a larger vote on the whole resolution. The Soviet Union agreed to the compromise on the condition that it was worded so that the General Assembly had to either admit all 18 countries or none of them.
However, after the Republic of China vetoed the amendment containing Mongolia, the Soviet Union cast 13 more vetoes on all the remaining applicants except those in Eastern Europe. The larger vote on the whole resolution, now containing only four Eastern European countries, then failed without veto as the Soviet Union was the only member to vote in favour.
