The Palm Springs Walk of the Stars is a Walk of the Stars in downtown Palm Springs, California. Embedded in the sidewalks, the Golden Palm Stars honor notable individuals who have lived in the greater Palm Springs region, across multiple categories. The walk spans sections streets on downtown Palm Springs.  
It was established in 1992 by Gerhard G. Frenzel and Barbara Foster-Henderson, with the inaugural ceremony held on February 26, 1992 and included Walk of the Stars chairman Johnny Grant. Modeled after the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the program has since honored presidents of the United States, showbusiness personalities, literary figures (authors, playwrights, screenwriters), pioneers and civic leaders (early settlers, tribal leaders, civic personalities), humanitarians and Medal of Honor recipients. As of 2025 nearly 480 stars have been dedicated.

History
Plans for a Palm Springs Walk of the Stars began in the early 1990s, led by Frenzel and Foster-Henderson in collaboration with the Palm Springs Chamber of Commerce and the City of Palm Springs. The first five Golden Palm Stars were unveiled during the February 26, 1992 ceremony. Early inductees included local figures like theater proprietor Earle C. Strebe and individuals prominent during the Hollywood Golden Age. By 1999, 139 stars had been installed, and by 2006 the total reached around 300.

During the 1990s and 2000s, honorees included entertainment professionals and local leaders such as Frank Sinatra, Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor, Liberace, Dinah Shore, and Sonny Bono. The Walk also recognized historical figures, like the chimpanzee “Cheeta” of Tarzan fame received a star in 1995, and President Gerald Ford in 1997.

Controversy
In 2004, Gerhard Frenzel resigned from the Walk of the Stars Foundation over the nomination of golfer Ken Venturi. 
In May 2017, installations were temporarily suspended while the Chamber and the City reviewed selection criteria amid concerns about the selection criteria. Later that year they resumed with stronger guidelines.

Nomination and induction process
The program is managed by the Palm Springs Chamber of Commerce in partnership with the City of Palm Springs. Anyone may submit a nomination, subject to the nominee's consent, for consideration by the Walk of Stars committee, which meets during the “season” (October–May). Typically 6–12 stars are approved and dedicated each season.
Nominees must have significant affiliation with the area and notable achievements in designated categories: Entertainment; Literary; Civic/Pioneer; Humanitarian; Architect/Artist/Designer; Athlete; and Military. Approved nominees (or their sponsors) must pay a sponsorship fee of US$15,000 as of 2023, covering the plaque, installation, ceremony, publicity, and an official city proclamation. Ceremonies are free public events held during the season, with honorees receiving a star replica and civic recognition. A mobile app and online map help visitors locate stars and learn about inductees.
