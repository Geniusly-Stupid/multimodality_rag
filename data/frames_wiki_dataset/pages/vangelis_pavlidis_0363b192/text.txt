After a slow start to the season, Pavlidis scored nine goals in eight matches, including the first goal in the 2–0 win over Juventus in the Champions League, on 29 January, securing his team's progression to the knockout phase play-offs qualification. In February, he scored in both legs against Monaco in the Champions League knockout phase play-offs as Benfica secured a 4–3 aggregate victory to advance to the Champions League round of 16.
