As of the 2020 census the population was 15,828. Along with Augusta, Waterville is one of the principal cities of the Augusta-Waterville, ME Micropolitan Statistical Area.

History
The area now known as Waterville was once inhabited by the Canibas tribe of the Abenaki people. Called "Taconnet" after Chief Taconnet, the main village was located on the east bank of the Kennebec River at its confluence with the Sebasticook River at what is now Winslow. Known as "Ticonic" by English settlers, it was burned in 1692 during King William's War, after which the Canibas tribe abandoned the area. Fort Halifax was built by General John Winslow in 1754, and the last skirmish with indigenous peoples occurred on May 18, 1757.
The township would be organized as Kingfield Plantation, then incorporated as Winslow in 1771. When residents on the west side of the Kennebec found themselves unable to cross the river to attend town meetings, Waterville was founded from the western parts of Winslow and incorporated on June 23, 1802. In 1824 a bridge was built joining the communities. Early industries included fishing, lumbering, agriculture and ship building, with larger boats launched in spring during freshets. By the early 1900s, there were five shipyards in the community.
Ticonic Falls blocked navigation farther upriver, so Waterville developed as the terminus for trade and shipping. The Kennebec River and Messalonskee Stream provided water power for mills, including several sawmills, a gristmill, a sash and blind factory, a furniture factory, and a shovel handle factory. There was also a carriage and sleigh factory, boot shop, brickyard, and tannery. On September 27, 1849, the Androscoggin and Kennebec Railroad opened to Waterville. It would become part of the Maine Central Railroad, which in 1870 established locomotive and car repair shops in the thriving mill town. West Waterville (renamed Oakland) was set off as a town in 1873. Waterville was incorporated as a city on January 12, 1888.
The Ticonic Water Power & Manufacturing Company was formed in 1866 and soon built a dam across the Kennebec. After a change of ownership in 1873, the company began construction on what would become the Lockwood Manufacturing Company, a cotton textile plant. A second mill was added, and by 1900 the firm dominated the riverfront and employed 1,300 workers. Lockwood Mills survived until the mid-1950s. The iron Waterville-Winslow Footbridge opened in 1901, as a means for Waterville residents to commute to Winslow for work in the Hollingsworth & Whitney Co. and Wyandotte Worsted Co. mills, but in less than a year was carried away by the highest river level since 1832. Rebuilt in 1903, it would be called the Two Cent Bridge because of its toll. In 1902, the Beaux-Arts style City Hall and Opera House designed by George Gilman Adams was dedicated. In 2002, the C.F. Hathaway Company, one of the last remaining factories in the United States producing high-end dress shirts, was purchased by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway company and was closed after over 160 years of operation in the city.
Waterville also developed as an educational center. In 1813, the Maine Literary and Theological Institution was established. It would be renamed Waterville College in 1821, then Colby College in 1867. Thomas College was established in 1894. The Latin School was founded in 1820 to prepare students to attend Colby and other colleges, and was subsequently named Waterville Academy, Waterville Classical Institute, and Coburn Classical Institute; the Institute merged with the Oak Grove School in Vassalboro in 1970, and remained open until 1989. The first public high school was built in 1877, while the current Waterville Senior High School was built in 1961.

The unemployment rate was 2.9% as of recent estimates, though the city faces economic challenges with 24.3% of residents living in poverty classified as unemployed.

Major employers
Waterville's largest employers include MaineGeneral Medical Center, Colby College, HealthReach Community Health Centers, Northern Light Inland Hospital, Hannaford Supermarket, Shaw's Supermarket, Walmart, Mount St. Joseph Nursing Home, Kennebec Valley Community Action Program, Thomas College, the City of Waterville, The Woodlands Residential Care, and Central Maine Newspapers. The presence of two colleges contributes significantly to the local economy, with Colby College alone investing over $70 million in downtown development since 2015.

Suburban development and downtown challenges
Like many American cities, Waterville has experienced suburban sprawl and downtown decline in recent decades. New commercial development has concentrated in the northern part of the city, including a Walmart, Home Depot, and strip mall shopping center on Kennedy Memorial Drive. This growth has contributed to the renovation of the existing Elm Plaza shopping center, which has filled previous vacancies.
The downtown area has faced challenges from chain store growth and retail shifts. Historic downtown businesses including Levine's, Butlers, Sterns, Dunhams, Alvina and Delias, and LaVerdieres have closed in recent decades. The Concourse shopping center, which formerly housed Ames and Zayre department stores as well as Brooks Pharmacy, has struggled to find tenants. A CVS pharmacy relocated from its Main Street location to a new building on Kennedy Memorial Drive.

Downtown revitalization
A comprehensive downtown revitalization effort has transformed Waterville's city center since 2015. The initiative represents a partnership between Colby College, the City of Waterville, and the Maine Department of Transportation, with more than $200 million in combined investment from the college, private investors, and small businesses. The project included an $11.2 million infrastructure improvement that converted one-way streets back to two-way traffic, enhanced walkways, lighting, and landscaping, and created new public spaces.
Key developments include the $26 million Lockwood Hotel, which opened in August 2022 as downtown's first new hotel in over a century. The 53-room hotel, developed by Colby College and managed by Charlestowne Hotels, features the Front & Main restaurant. The $18 million Paul J. Schupf Art Center opened in December 2022 as a 32,000-square-foot facility housing visual and performing arts programs, serving as headquarters for Waterville Creates and operated in partnership with Colby College.
Waterville Main Street, designated as a Main Street Maine community in 2001 and accredited annually by the National Main Street Center, coordinates ongoing revitalization efforts through economic development, design improvement, promotion, and organizational initiatives.

Industrial redevelopment
The historic Hathaway Mill complex has undergone extensive redevelopment for mixed-use purposes. Developer Paul Boghossian initially converted portions of the former C.F. Hathaway Company textile facility to retail, office, and residential use, with MaineGeneral Health becoming the first tenant in 2007.
North River Co. acquired the Hathaway Creative Center in 2017 for $20.1 million and subsequently purchased additional mill buildings in 2019 for $1.5 million. The company is developing a $40 million project to convert the former Lockwood Mill at 6 Water Street into 65 affordable housing units, funded through low-income housing tax credits, federal and state historic tax credits, and $1 million in American Rescue Plan Act financing. The project is expected to have significant economic impact through increased housing stock, population growth, and downtown foot traffic.

Government
Local government
Waterville has a mayor and council-manager form of government, led by a mayor and a seven-member city council. The city council is the governing board, and the city manager is the chief administrative officer of the city, responsible for the management of all city affairs.
Waterville adopted a city charter in the 1970s. For some 40 years, the city had a "strong mayor" system in which the mayor enjoyed broad executive powers, including the power to veto measures passed by the city council and to line-item veto budget items passed by the council. In 2005, the charter was substantially revised, changing the city government to a "weak mayor" council-manager system. Under the present system, the city manager is the chief executive. The charter revision was approved by city voters by a 4–1 margin. The city is currently divided into seven geographic wards, each of which elects one member of the Waterville City Council and one member of the Waterville School Board.
Since 1970, the following people have served as mayor of Waterville: Richard "Spike" Carey (1970–1978), Paul Laverdiere (Republican, 1978–1982); Ann Gilbride Hill (Democrat, 1982–1986); Thomas Nale (1986–1987); Judy C. Kany (Democrat, 1988–1989); David E. Bernier (1990–1993); Thomas J. Brazier (1994–1995); Nelson Megna (1995–1996); Ruth Joseph (Democrat, 1996–1998); Nelson Madore (Democrat, 1999–2004); Paul R. LePage (Republican, 2004–2011); Dana W. Sennett (Democrat, 2011); Karen Heck (independent, 2012–2014); Nicholas Isgro (Republican, 2015–2020); Jay Coelho (2021–present).
In 2018, Isgro faced a recall election after he made a Twitter post insulting a gun control activist present during the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. The recall effort was backed by former Mayor Karen Heck, a Democrat who had previously endorsed Isgro. Isgro later made his Twitter feed private and said that he had deleted the post. During the recall effort, Isgro asserted that outside interests and the City Council were plotting to oust him over disputes over the city budget and taxation. After an acrimonious recall campaign, Waterville voters defeated the recall attempt, with 1,563 "no" votes (51%) to 1,472 "yes" votes (49%).

Waterville is considered a Democratic stronghold in Maine's 1st congressional district. Barack Obama received 70% of Waterville's votes in the 2008 presidential election.
