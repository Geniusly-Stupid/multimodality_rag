Mateo Retegui (born 29 April 1999) is a professional footballer who plays as a striker for Saudi Pro League club Al-Qadsiah. Born in Argentina, he plays for the Italy national team.

Early life
Retegui was born and raised in Argentina.  His maternal grandfather, Angelo Dimarco, emigrated to Argentina from Canicattì, Sicily. His father's grandparents on one side of the family were also Italian, specifically from Genoa, while the paternal ancestors were originally Basque (the surname Retegui being from Gipuzkoa, Spain).
He is the son of former field hockey player Carlos Retegui, who represented Argentina as a player and coach at various Pan American Games and Olympic Games. His sister Micaela is also an Olympian field hockey player.

Club career
Early career in Argentina
Retegui began his senior career with Boca Juniors, who signed him years prior from River Plate. He was first promoted into the club's first-team by manager Guillermo Barros Schelotto during the 2017–18 Argentine Primera División season, appearing as an unused substitute on occasions against Arsenal de Sarandí and Estudiantes in December 2017. His professional debut arrived on 17 November 2018, with the forward being substituted on for the final moments of a 1–0 home win over Patronato.
January 2019 saw Retegui loaned to Estudiantes for eighteen months. He appeared eight times in 2018–19, before scoring five goals in twenty-one appearances in 2019–20.
In February 2022, Retegui joined Tigre on a loan deal until the end of 2023.

Genoa

Atalanta
Retegui moved to fellow Serie A club Atalanta in a deal worth a reported €28 million on 8 August 2024, following an anterior cruciate ligament injury to Atalanta forward and Italy teammate Gianluca Scamacca. Later that year, on 26 November, he scored his first Champions League goals by netting a brace in a 6–1 away victory over Young Boys. He scored four goals in a 5–0 demolition of Hellas Verona on 8 February 2025, in which he became the first player to score a first-half hat-trick for Atalanta in Serie A.

Retegui received his first official call up to the Italy national team on 17 March 2023, and proceeded to score in his international debut on 23 March against England in a Euro 2024 qualifying match lost 2–1 in Naples. He would tally again in his subsequent appearance on 26 March, netting the winner in a 2–0 win over Malta in a Euro 2024 qualifier in Ta' Qali, to become the first player to score in his first two competitive matches for the national side since Pierino Prati accomplished the feat in 1968.
On 21 March 2024, Retegui scored twice in a 2–1 victory over Venezuela. He was the first Genoa player to score a brace for Italy since Virgilio Levratto at the 1928 Summer Olympics.
