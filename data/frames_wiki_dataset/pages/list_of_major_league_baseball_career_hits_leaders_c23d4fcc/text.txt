Nap Lajoie was the first player to accumulate 2,000 hits in the American League, doing so in the 1912 season.
For many years, George Davis was considered the first switch hitter to collect 2,000 hits, achieving that total during the 1902 season. However, recent research in the 2010s has revealed that 19th century hitter Roger Connor also batted right-handed at times in his career; he reached 2,000 hits in the 1893 season.
