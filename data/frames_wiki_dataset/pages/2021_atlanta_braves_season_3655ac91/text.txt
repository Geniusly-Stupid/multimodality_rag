Regular season
The 2021 season wasn't a smooth sailing road for the Atlanta Braves. The Braves started off 0-4 and ended April with a 12-14 record. At the All-Star Break they were 44-45. After the All-Star Break in August they started ramping it up and went 18-8. On August 8th, they climbed over .500 for the first time, at 57-56, and on Aug 15. they took over first place in the NL East, ending up winning the NL East with a 88-73 record.
The team's turnaround began after July 10th when Ronald Acuña Jr. suffered a season ending injury and the trade deadline approached. After the Braves' star outfielder got injured, GM Alex Anthopoulos remade his outfield by bringing in veterans Adam Duvall, Joc Pederson, Eddie Rosario, and Jorge Soler. They made a huge impact on the team with Duvall finishing the season with a National League-leading 113 RBIs (45 with the Braves); Pederson hit a game winning home run in the NLDS against the Brewers; Rosario was the NLCS MVP; Soler was the World Series MVP.
