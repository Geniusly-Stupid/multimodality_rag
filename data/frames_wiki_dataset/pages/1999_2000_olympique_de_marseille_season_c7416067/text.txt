Olympique de Marseille nearly crashed out of the French league following a chaotic season, in which all things that could go wrong, indeed went that way. Despite having several internationally respected players in the squad, only goal difference saved the team from being relegated. On the other hand, l'OM was only seven points behind Lens in fifth, suggesting that the league was the tightest ever.
