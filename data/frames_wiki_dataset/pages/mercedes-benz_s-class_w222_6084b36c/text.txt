The Mercedes-Benz W222 is the sixth generation of the Mercedes Benz S-Class; it was produced from 2013 to 2020, serving as the successor to the W221 S-Class and predecessor to the W223 S-Class. The W222 was designed in 2009 by Korean designer Il-hun Yoon, who drew inspiration from the Mercedes-Benz F700 concept car. The exterior design was developed by a team under the direction of the Slovenian car designer Robert Lešnik. The W222 has a design theme similar to the C-Class (W205) and E-Class (W213).
In Europe, sales of the S400 Hybrid, S350 BlueTEC, S350 BlueTEC Hybrid, and S500 began in September 2013; and sales of the S550 in the United States also began on that same month. The four-wheel drive (4Matic) model went on sale in November, and additional models, including V12 models and those from AMG, were released in 2014.
The W222 S-Class debuted on 15 May 2013, in Hamburg, Germany, and entered production in Sindelfingen, Germany, in June 2013.
Production of the W222 ended in September 2020 with the introduction of its successor, the S-Class (W223).

Suspension
Mercedes' hydropneumatic, active suspension, known as Active Body Control, was updated with a system dubbed Magic Body Control (MBC), which is fitted with a road-sensing system ("road surface scan") that pre-scans the road for uneven surfaces, potholes, and bumps. Using a stereo camera, the system scans the road surface up to 15 meters ahead of the vehicle at speeds up to 130 km/h (81 mph), and it adjusts the shock damping at each wheel to account for imperfections in the road. As of 2017, MBC was not available on any of the 4Matic models.

S 500 e (2014–2017)
The S 550 e is a plug-in hybrid version of the long wheelbase S-Class sedan, with a 3.0-litre V6 twin-turbo engine rated at 245 kW; 328 hp (333 PS) and 480 N⋅m (354 lb⋅ft) and an electric motor rated at 80 kW; 108 hp (109 PS) and 340 N⋅m (251 lb⋅ft), and with an externally rechargeable 8.7kWh battery pack. It features 4 hybrid operating modes (HYBRID, E‑MODE, E-SAVE, and CHARGE), second-generation regenerative braking system, haptic accelerator pedal, pre-entry climate control of the interior, and Intelligent HYBRID with (dis)charging management based on COMAND Online navigation data.
The all electric range is about 30 km (19 mi) under the New European Driving Cycle. Under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tests, the S 500 e has an all-electric range of 14 mi (23 km), with some gasoline consumption (0.1 gal/100 mi). So, the actual all-electric range is rated between 0 and 12 mi (0 and 19 km).
The EPA, under its five-cycle tests, rated the 2015 S 500 e energy consumption in all-electric mode at 59 kWh per 100 miles, which translates into a combined city/highway fuel economy of 58 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPG-e) (4.1 L/100 km; 70 mpg−imp gasoline equivalent). When powered only by the gasoline engine, EPA's official combined city/highway fuel economy is 26 mpg‑US (9.0 L/100 km; 31 mpg‑imp).
The production vehicle was unveiled in Toronto in 2013, followed by the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. Deliveries began in September 2014 in Europe, starting at a price of €108,945 (~US$146,000). The U.S. launch was slated for early 2015. A total of 17 units were registered in Germany as of September 2014. According to JATO Dynamics, a total of 38 units were registered in Europe through September 2014.

S 600
The S 600 is a version of the long-wheelbase S-Class sedan with a 6.0-litre V12 biturbo engine rated at 390 kW; 523 hp (530 PS) and 830 N⋅m (612 lb⋅ft) at 1,900 rpm. Features include ECO start/stop function, optional touchpad, optional head-up display, Collision Prevention Assist Plus, and optional electric windscreen heating. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2014 North American International Auto Show and went on sale in March 2014.

Mercedes-Maybach
In 2015, Mercedes brought back the Maybach name as a sub-brand of the Mercedes lineup. The first model produced was the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, designed to compete against the Bentley Mulsanne and Rolls-Royce Phantom VIII. At 5,453 mm (214.7 in) long with a wheelbase of 3,365 mm (132.5 in), the new model is approximately 20 cm (7.9 in) larger, in both dimensions, compared to the long-wheelbase S-Class models.
The Mercedes-Maybach is available in S 500 and S 600 models (the US received the Mercedes-Maybach S 550 4MATIC and S 600 models, with the S 550 having the same 4.7L engine as the S 500 Mercedes-Maybach elsewhere), with 4MATIC optional, with the V8 engine and V12 for the latter. Mercedes also claims that the S Class is the world's quietest production car. The basic car has colour options and the option of a rear bench seat or 2 reclining rear seats. Options include air-conditioned, heated, and massaging seats; heated armrests; a system to pump agarwood scented ionised air around the cabin; first-class suite for the rear cabin; and a 24-speaker, 1,540 watt Burmester High-End 3D surround sound system.
Assembly of the Maybach S 500 started in Pune, India, in September 2015, India being the second country to produce a Maybach.
In 2017, the facelift S 600 was discontinued, while the S 650 was introduced (with the engine of the former S 65 AMG).
The Mercedes-Maybach S 600 and S 650 were also available in a Pullman version, a chauffeur-driven sedan that includes a partition-separated rear passenger compartment with two sets of paired-facing seats. This version is equipped with the V12 dual-turbocharger gasoline engine, the seven-speed automatic transmission, and rear-wheel drive. The same vehicle is additionally available as an armoured version, known as the Pullman Guard.
At the 2017 Shanghai Motor Show, a new Chinese-only Mercedes-Maybach S 680 was introduced for the 2018 model year and onward. In China and other Asian countries, the number 8 is very auspicious, being closely associated with luck and wealth; hence, Mercedes' decision to name it as they did. The S 680 is essentially identical to the S 650 where equipment is concerned.

W222 facelift (2017–2020)
A mid-cycle refresh was unveiled in April 2017 and entered production on 3 July 2017 for the 2018 model year. The refresh introduces the new 48-volt integrated starter/alternator, ENERGIZING Comfort Control, and updated autonomous driving technologies. The grille is updated to differentiate between six and eight-cylinder engine versions and long wheelbase and V12 versions. The headlamps and taillamps are also revised with new, enhanced LED technology.
A new range of six-cylinder inline petrol and diesel engines is offered with electrification (20 kilowatts/22 horsepower). This marks the return of six-cylinder inline engines to the S-Class, since the last one was offered in 2005. The engine is 2,999 cc (3.0 L) for both petrol and 2,927 cc (2.9 L) diesel engines. The sole gas V6 engine is in the S 560 e with a plug-in hybrid system. The four-cylinder inline engine with a hybrid system (S 300 h) was removed from the S-Class model range. Additionally, the old 4.7-litre V8 petrol engine is replaced by the new AMG-engineered 4.0-litre biturbo V8, consolidating the V8 engine range to one size. 2019 marks the final year of the S 65 AMG, with 130 units to be finished in obsidian black metallic paint with bronze highlights on the body and alloy wheels. However, the 6.0-litre V12 AMG carries on in the Maybach S 650 after the production of the S 65 AMG ended.
Inline 6 and V8 engines are now paired with the 9-speed 9G-TRONIC automatic transmission (AMG Speedshift MCT for S 63 AMG 4MATIC+) while V12 engines continue to use the 7G-TRONIC PLUS transmission.
The S 63 AMG 4MATIC+ became the sole choice for the V8 version of the S-Class from AMG, eliminating the previous rear-wheel-drive version.
