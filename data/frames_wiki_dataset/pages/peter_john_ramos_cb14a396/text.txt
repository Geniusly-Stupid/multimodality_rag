Professional wrestling career
World Wrestling Council (2019–2020)
In 2016, Ramos expressed interest in making a crossover into professional wrestling following his retirement from basketball, noting he had already declined invitations to do so. Others in his family were already involved in the business, his brother-in-law is an in-ring performer and his sister is a referee. Two years later he reaffirmed this plan, believing that the retirement of several high-profile tall wrestlers created more opportunities to succeed. On September 18, 2019, Ramos made his first backstage appearance for the World Wrestling Council, becoming involved in a segment with Puerto Rico Heavyweight Champion Pedro Portillo III. This led to Ramos appearing as the guest referee of a retirement match between Ray González and Gilbert (storyline boss to Portillo) at Noche de Campeones. Prior to this, Carlos Colón Sr. noted that he was monitoring his progress.
Ramos was booked in a heel turn on González, afterward joining the villainous faction known as El Sindicato, which was disbanded at the end of the season. Afterwards he became the enforcer of a nascent stable known as The Dynasty, joining Eddie Colón and Gilbert. Ramos’ in ring debut took place on January 25, 2020, in a handicap match where he easily defeated two independent wrestlers. The following week he scored another swift win over Jax, a third party performer for the regional Borinquén Sport Promotion (BSP). An extreme rules match against fellow multi-sport athlete Carlos Cotto was scheduled for February 15, 2019, but later postponed when Ramos refused to perform in “a small town” by citing contractual clauses. This role actually helped his basketball career, since it allowed him to drop 30 pounds and begin the 2020 BSN season in shape.

Beast Mode (2020–present)
During the hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Ramos left WWC and joined Germán Figueroa to form a team known as Beast Mode, with Qatar Pro Wrestling as their first promotion abroad. When the BSN resumed the 2020 season in a bubble, he didn't participate with the Leones in order to dedicate full time to professional wrestling. On December 18, 2021, Beast Mode made its debut for Organization International de Lucha (OIL) with a win over Sons of Samoa. The alliance that this company had with Robles Promotions led to Ramos wrestling in Mexico in January 2022, adopting Mr. Beast as his ring name. The team also made appearances for Wrestling República Dominicana (WRD).
In 2023, Ramos joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and debuted in NWA Powerrr against Trevor Murdoch, performing under the ring name Beast Mode.
