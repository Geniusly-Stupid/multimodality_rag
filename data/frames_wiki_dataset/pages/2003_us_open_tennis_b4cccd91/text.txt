The 2003 US Open was held between August 25 – September 7, 2003.
Both Pete Sampras and Serena Williams did not defend their titles from 2002; Sampras unofficially retired after winning his final Grand Slam title the previous year, and Serena Williams was forced to miss the tournament after withdrawing through injury. This was the first time since 1971 in which neither champion was able to defend their title.
Andy Roddick, who previously won the 2000 US Open as a junior, won his only Grand Slam title, defeating Juan Carlos Ferrero (who inherited the World No.1 ranking after the tournament) in the final. Justine Henin-Hardenne won her first US Open title and second Grand Slam title, defeating her compatriot, rival and future 3-time US Open champion Kim Clijsters in the final, dropping only one set through her run.
