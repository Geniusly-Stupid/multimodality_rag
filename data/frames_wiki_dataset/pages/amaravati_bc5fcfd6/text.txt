Amaravati (English:  uh-mə-RAH-vuh-thi, Telugu: Amarāvati) is the capital city of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is located in Guntur district on the right bank of the Krishna River, 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) southwest of Vijayawada. The city derives its name from the nearby historic site of Amaravathi, which served as the capital of the Satavahana Empire nearly two thousand years ago.
The city is an urban notified area. Urban development and planning activities are undertaken by the Amaravati Development Corporation Limited and Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA). The APCRDA has jurisdiction over the city and the conurbation covering Andhra Pradesh Capital Region. The city is spread over an area of 217.23 km2 (83.87 sq mi), and comprises villages (including some hamlets) from three mandals viz., Mangalagiri, Thullur and Tadepalli. The seed capital is spread over an area of 16.94 km2 (6.54 sq mi).
The bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014 resulted in the residual state having no capital city, with Hyderabad serving as the state's temporary capital city despite being located in the new state of Telangana. The government under the leadership of N. Chandrababu Naidu founded Amaravati and declared it as Andhra Pradesh state's new capital city. The farmers of Guntur district gave 33,000 acres of land, to the Government of Andhra Pradesh through an innovative land pooling  scheme in return for developed plots and lease payments for 10-year period. The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone at Uddandarayunipalem village on 22 October 2015. After fast track completion of interim buildings, government legislature and secretariat started operating from the new facilities at Velagapudi from March 2017.

Etymology
Amaravati literally translates to "the abode of immortals". The name holds deep historical, spiritual and mythological significance. The name is also used for a region near Dharanikota, which served as the ancient capital of the Satavahana dynasty, also known as the Andhras. In Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, Amaravati is the celestial capital of Swarga (heaven), where the Devas (gods) reside.

History
Early and medieval history
The neighbouring Dharanikota (Dhānyakatakam) was the capital city of the Satavahana dynasty. Its history dates back to the second century BCE. The Satavahanas are prominent in the history of Andhra Pradesh. Their primary language was Prakrit written using the Brahmi script, which served as the base for of Telugu script. The practice of Buddhism was predominant during their period and the dynasty was partly responsible for the prevalence of the faith in the region. The city was also once a holy site of Mahayana Buddhism. The city used to have a large Buddhist Stupa, now known as Amaravati Stupa. It was also the centre of Buddhist learning and art with several Buddhist followers from many South East Asian countries visiting.  
The Satavahanas, Ikshvakus, Vishnukundina, Pallavas, Cholas, Kakatiyas, Delhi Sultanate, Musunuri Nayaks, Bahmani Sultanate, Vijayanagara Empire, Sultanate of Golconda and the Mughal Empire successively ruled this area before the founding of the Nizamate of Hyderabad in 1724. It was ceded to France in 1750, but was captured by the East India Company in 1759. It was returned to the Nizam in 1768, but was ceded to Britain again in 1788. As part of the Madras Presidency, it was ruled by Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu, the hereditary zamindar of Chintapalli, who founded modern Amaravathi village, near the ruins of the ancient stupa.

Foundation of Amaravati
As per the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, Hyderabad became the capital of the newly formed state of Telangana, post bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. The Central Government formed an expert committee to explore alternatives for the new capital of Andhra Pradesh, in accordance with the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. The committee was tasked with evaluating the suitability of various locations based on data analysis, site visits, and stakeholder consultations. Its duties included assessing the availability of land, water, and natural resources while considering environmental sustainability and the potential for urban growth. It evaluated transportation options including rail, road and air connectivity between the new capital and other major cities. The committee consisted of several experts from various national institutes.

Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu announced that the new capital of the state would be located around Vijayawada. This decision followed a consultative process and was approved by the State Cabinet on September 1, 2014. Chief Minister Naidu stated that the state planned a decentralised development approach, with three mega cities and 14 smart cities. The announcement came amid calls from the opposition YSR Congress Party for a debate on the capital's location. Chief Minister Naidu emphasized that the decision reflects public sentiment, with nearly 50% of representations received by the Sivaramakrishnan Committee favoring the Vijayawada-Guntur region. He also highlighted the need for Central Government support for capital development and special status for the state as assured during the passage of the State Reorganisation Bill.
On October 22, 2015, following a cabinet meeting where it was unanimously approved, Chief Minister Naidu announced the selection of Amaravathi, an ancient town located on the banks of the Krishna River, as the site for the new capital city. During the foundation-laying ceremony, attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Naidu discussed plans for the capital's development, which aimed to focus on creating an energy-efficient city with industrial hubs. The completion date for the master plan’s first phase was set for May 15, 2016, and plans were proposed for a 200-km ring road to connect Amaravati with Vijayawada and Guntur.
The establishment of Amaravati as the new capital of Andhra Pradesh involved a land pooling initiative crucial for its development. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu's administration implemented the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) Act in 2014, which facilitated the creation of a land bank for the new capital. The Act allowed for voluntary land pooling, enabling landowners to surrender their land in exchange for developed plots and financial compensation. The government aimed to acquire approximately 53,748 acres of land from 27 villages. Around 33,733 acres were pooled through this scheme.  While many farmers participated, some, particularly from Penumaka and Undavalli, expressed concerns about compensation rates. The pooling process aggregated small land parcels, which were then improved and partially returned to the original owners. The initiative also included annuity payments for ten years, providing financial support to those who surrendered their land.

Establishing governance
The construction of the temporary Andhra Pradesh Secretariat at Velagapudi, 16 km from Vijayawada, was completed on the October 3, 2016 with a budget of ₹230 crores. By October 17, 2016, five of the six planned blocks began operations. The Secretariat, covering 45 acres, is designed in a G-plus-1 style. The first block houses the Chief Minister's Office, while the others accommodate various ministers and the sixth block is intended for the AP Assembly and Legislative Council. The Andhra Pradesh High Court has also moved to a new temporary building in Amaravati, inaugurated by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi. This new court complex includes 16 court halls and a 2.70 lakh square feet office space. Advocates have faced challenges due to a lack of necessary facilities in the new building, including poor broadband and library access. Despite initial difficulties, legal professionals remain optimistic about the future of the new high court and capital city.
