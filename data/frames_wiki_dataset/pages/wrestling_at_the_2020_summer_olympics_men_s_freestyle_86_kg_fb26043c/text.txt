The men's freestyle 86 kilograms competition at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, took place on 4–5 August 2021 at the Makuhari Messe in Mihama-ku. The qualification rounds were held on 4 August, with medal matches the next day.
This freestyle wrestling competition consists of a single-elimination tournament, with a repechage used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.
The medals for the competition were presented by the United World Wrestling president Nenad Lalović, IOC Executive Board Member from Serbia, and the medalists' bouquets were presented by Pedro Gama Filho, UWW Board Member from Brazil.
David Taylor from the United States won the gold medal after beating 2016 Olympic Champion Hassan Yazdani from Iran 4–3 in the gold medal match.
