Defending champion Novak Djokovic defeated Andy Murray in a rematch of the previous year's final, 6–1, 7–5, 7–6(7–3) to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2016 Australian Open. It was his record-equaling sixth Australian Open men's singles title (tying Roy Emerson) and eleventh major title overall. This was the fourth Australian Open final between the pair. Murray was the second man in the Open Era to lose five finals at the same major (after Ivan Lendl at the US Open) (Novak Djokovic broke that record when he lost his 6th US Open final in 2021), and is the only one to have the distinction without having won the title.
This marked the final professional appearance of former world No. 1, two-time major champion and 2005 finalist Lleyton Hewitt; he lost to David Ferrer in the second round.
This marked the 65th consecutive grand slam appearance for Federer, setting a new record by breaking Wayne Ferreira’s previous record of 54 consecutive grand slam appearances set in 1994 (Feliciano López broke Federer’s record and set the new, and current, record at 79 consecutive grand slam appearances from 2002 to 2022).
